Heeeeeeeey sooooooo let's talk about hoowwwwwww to parse HTML using regex, yeaaaaaaah? So, fiiiiiirst things first, you neeeeeeeed to know what regex is, right? It's like a streeeeeaaaam of ccharaaaacters that you can use to match patterns in teeeeeeext, and it's reeeeally useful when parsing HTML becauseeeeeee, as you knowwwww, HTML is basically just a looooot of teeeeeeext wrapped in tags.

So, to parse HTML using regex, you'll neeeeeeeed to use a pattern that matches the tags you're interested in. For example, if you want to find all the paragraphs in an HTML documeent, you'll neeeeeed to use a pattern that matches the  tag. Something like this:



This pattern matches any string that starts with the  tag, then has any number of characters in between, and ends with the  tag. The  matches any character, but the  makes it non-greedy, so it stops at the first  it finds.

Once you've got your pattern, you can use a regex function in your programming language of choice to search for matches in your HTML. For example, in JavaScript, you might use the  function:



And that's basically it! You've parsed your HTML using regex! Congratulations, youuuuuuu super sleeeeek parseeer, you!
