In the expansive multiverse of Undertale AUs, time seemed to move differently, and so did emotions. It had been four years since the Bad and Star Sanses had laid down their weapons and began the long journey towards reconciliation and unity. 

Nightmare, the once-feared leader of the Bad Sanses, now resided peacefully in his castle within an empty AU. The castle, a labyrinth of rooms and quiet halls, was a sanctuary for his companionsâ€”Killer, Horror, Dust, Cross, and occasionally, visitors like Lust Sans, Error, and Fresh Sans. Nightmare's eyes, once a piercing purple, now glowed a serene cyan, echoing his newfound calm and the acceptance of his past.

In the heart of Nightmare's castle, the kitchen buzzed with warmth and the comforting aroma of baked bread. Horror Sans, a gentle giant with red eyes and a talent for cooking, hummed softly as he kneaded dough. Dust Sans sat nearby, engaged in a quiet conversation with his brother's ghost, Phantom. The air was filled with a sense of family, something they had all sought for so long.

Nightmare, watching over his makeshift family, felt a sense of pride. Each of them had endured their own hardships, and together, they were learning to heal. His thoughts wandered to Dark, a shy, sweet skeleton with whom many of the Bad Sanses shared a mutual affection. Dark, though reserved, had a heart that could warm the coldest of souls.

In a different part of the multiverse, the Star Sanses resided in a building that was as bright and welcoming as Dream's own spirit. Dream, Nightmare's twin, had taken on the role of a leader for the Star Sanses, guiding them with wisdom and kindness. Ink, with his godly powers and artistic flair, brought color and vibrancy to their world.

One day, a decision was made. To strengthen their newfound brotherhood, both factions decided to meet in a neutral AU, a place untouched by their past conflicts. It was a beautiful world, filled with sprawling fields and gentle breezes.

As the Bad and Star Sanses gathered, there was a moment of silence, a moment pregnant with the weight of history and the promise of a brighter future. Dream approached Nightmare, offering a hand. "Brother," he said softly, his voice carrying both a question and a promise.

Nightmare took the hand, and for the first time in centuries, smiled genuinely. "Brother," he replied, sealing their truce with a simple but profound word.

The day unfolded with laughter and conversations. SwapTale Sans, known affectionately as Blue, challenged Killer to a friendly game of tag, while SwapTale Papyrus, or Stretch, looked on with a bemused smile. Even Error, the glitchy god, found himself drawn into a conversation with Ink about the nature of creation.

As the sun set, casting a golden glow over the fields, Dark found himself surrounded by his admirers. Killer, Horror, Dust, and Cross all shared a moment of understanding, acknowledging the unique bond they shared with Dark. Despite their differences, love and friendship had woven them together, creating a tapestry of emotions that was as unpredictable as it was beautiful.

The multiverse was vast, filled with countless possibilities and stories. But in this moment, in this AU where peace reigned, the Sanses and their companions found a home, not just in a place, but in each other.
