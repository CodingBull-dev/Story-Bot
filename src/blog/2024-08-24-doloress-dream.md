Dolores had always dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol. She spent countless hours in her room, perfecting her dance moves and singing along to her favorite songs. Her best friend, Kiki, shared her passion for dance, and together they often choreographed routines and recorded themselves for fun. One sunny afternoon, Kiki burst into Dolores's room with exciting news.

"Dolores, JYP Entertainment is holding auditions for new trainees! We have to submit a video!" Kiki exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.

Dolores's heart skipped a beat. JYP Entertainment was one of the biggest entertainment companies in South Korea, home to some of her favorite idols. The idea of auditioning for them seemed like a dream come true.

"Let's do it," Dolores said, determination filling her voice.

The next day, they headed to the local gym, where they often practiced their routines. The gym was spacious, with mirrored walls that allowed them to see every move they made. They set up their camera and began to dance, pouring their hearts into every step. After several takes, they finally had a video they were proud of.

With a mixture of excitement and nerves, Dolores submitted the video. Days turned into weeks, and just when she began to lose hope, an email arrived. Dolores's hands trembled as she opened it.

"Congratulations! You have been selected for a live audition with JYP Entertainment."

Dolores could hardly believe her eyes. She screamed with joy, and Kiki joined in, both of them jumping up and down in excitement. The live audition was scheduled for the following week, and Dolores knew she had to give it her all.

On the day of the audition, Dolores arrived at the venue, her heart pounding in her chest. She was surrounded by other hopefuls, each one just as eager for a chance to shine. When her turn came, she stepped onto the stage, took a deep breath, and began her performance. Her voice was steady and strong, and her dance moves were sharp and precise. She felt the music flow through her, and for those few minutes, she was in her element.

The judges watched intently, and when she finished, they whispered among themselves. Dolores waited, her heart in her throat. Finally, one of the judges spoke.

"Thank you, Dolores. We will be in touch."

A month later, Dolores received another email, this time with even more incredible news. She had passed the audition and was invited to start her training in Korea. She could hardly contain her excitement as she packed her bags and boarded a flight to Seoul.

When she arrived at Incheon International Airport, she was greeted by the bustling energy of the city. She took a taxi to the JYP headquarters, her heart racing with anticipation. As she stepped out of the taxi and approached the building, a man in a sharp suit approached her.

"Are you Dolores?" he asked, his expression serious.

"Yes, that's me," she replied, feeling a bit nervous.

"Please follow me," he said, leading her into the building and down a series of hallways. They finally stopped in front of an office door, and he gestured for her to enter.

Inside, a man sat behind a large desk, his eyes focused on a stack of papers. He looked up as she entered and smiled warmly.

"Hello, Dolores. I'm Nim Fanpage, the manager of Straykids," he said, extending his hand.

Dolores shook his hand, her mind racing. She had heard of Straykids, one of the most popular K-pop groups in the world. What could he possibly want with her?

"I have a proposition for you," Nim Fanpage continued. "We have been looking to add a new dynamic to Straykids, and we believe you would be a perfect fit as the only female member of the group."

Dolores was stunned. She had never imagined such an opportunity. Joining Straykids would be a dream come true, but it was also a huge responsibility.

"I... I don't know what to say," she stammered.

Nim Fanpage smiled and handed her a business card. "Take your time to think about it. We believe in your talent, and we think you could bring something special to the group. Let me know your decision soon."

With that, he rushed off to another meeting, leaving Dolores standing in the office, her mind spinning. She looked down at the business card in her hand, feeling a mixture of excitement and uncertainty. This was the chance of a lifetime, and she knew she had to seize it.

As she walked out of the office, she felt a sense of determination wash over her. She was ready to take on the challenge and prove herself. With a deep breath, she made her decision. She would join Straykids and give it everything she had.

Dolores's journey to becoming a K-pop idol had only just begun, and she was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
