Romeo: Good morrow, fair Juliet. How art thou this day?

Juliet: I am well, Romeo. But I fear our love is doomed.

Romeo: What do you mean, my love?

Juliet: Our families will never approve of our love. It is not because of our names, but because of our phones.

Romeo: Our phones? What mean you by that?

Juliet: My family uses Android phones, while yours uses iPhones. They will never accept that we are together.

Romeo: Ah, I see. But does it truly matter what type of phone we use?

Juliet: To our families, it does. They believe that the type of phone we use reflects our values and beliefs.

Romeo: Then let us show them that our love is stronger than any phone preference. We shall use a Nokia phone, for it is a symbol of durability and reliability.

Juliet: Yes, let us do that. Our love shall not be hindered by something as trivial as a phone preference.

Romeo: My sweet Juliet, I shall love thee till the end of time, no matter what phone we use.

Juliet: And I shall love thee, Romeo, till the stars fall from the sky. Let us go forth and show our families that love knows no bounds, not even in the world of technology.


## Prompt
```markdown
Write a conversation between Romeo and Juliet in modern times.
Keep Shakespeare's writing style. They HAVE phones.
The conflict is not the family names, but that Romeo's family uses iPhone while Juliet's family uses Android phones and they will never approve that.
They must conclude saying that they will use a Nokia Phone if that will let their love flourish.
