I was always a fan of video games, but when the new Virtual Reality game was released, I knew I had to try it. The game was called "Infinite World" and it promised to be the most immersive gaming experience ever created. I entered the game for the first time and was immediately transported to a beautiful world filled with endless possibilities. The graphics were so realistic that I felt like I was really there.

I started playing the game every day, for hours on end. I would spend all my free time exploring the vast world and completing quests. I even started spending money on in-game purchases to improve my character's abilities. I couldn't get enough of the game, and soon it became the only thing I thought about.

One day, I lost my job because I had been spending too much time playing the game instead of working. At first, I didn't care. I had the game to keep me company, and I didn't need anything else. I stopped seeing my friends and family, and instead spent all my time in the game. I even started to form relationships with other players, who became my new "family".

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I lost track of time and space, and the only thing that mattered was the game. I started to feel like I was living in the game, and that the real world was just a distant memory.

Then, something strange happened. I couldn't tell if the events that were happening were real or if they were happening inside the game. I started to lose my grip on reality, and I didn't know what was real anymore.

Years went by, and I was still playing the game. I had aged in the real world, but my character in the game remained the same. I had become addicted to the game, and I couldn't stop playing.

But there were a few people who had never played the game. They had seen how it had destroyed the lives of so many people, and they were determined to stop it from spreading any further. They formed a group and started searching for survivors of the game, hoping to find someone who could help them hack into the game and delete it from the world.

I was one of the few survivors they found. They hacked into my mind and deleted the game, freeing me from its grasp. It was like waking up from a long dream, and I was finally able to see the world for what it really was.

Looking back, I realized how much I had lost because of my addiction to the game. I had lost my job, my friends, and my family. But now, with the game gone, I had a chance to start over and rebuild my life. I was grateful to the group who had saved me, and I knew that I would never let myself get addicted to anything like that again.
