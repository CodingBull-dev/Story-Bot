Once upon a time, there was a dinosaur named Rex who was unlike any other. He was massive, with sharp teeth and a ferocious appetite. But what made Rex truly unique was his insatiable hunger for the world itself. He didn't just want to eat prey, he wanted to devour everything in his path, including mountains, oceans, and even the sky.

As Rex roamed the earth, he left a trail of destruction in his wake. He chomped through forests and flattened cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dust. People and animals alike fled in terror at the sight of him, but Rex was unstoppable. He grew larger and stronger with each passing day, and his appetite only grew with him.

Soon, there was nothing left for Rex to eat on the earth. He had consumed every last tree, every last building, and every last creature. But still, he was hungry. So Rex turned his attention to the sky, opening his massive jaws and swallowing the sun, the moon, and the stars.

As the world plunged into darkness, Rex continued to eat, his appetite now extending beyond the physical realm. He devoured time itself, consuming the past, present, and future in one enormous gulp. And then, with a final, thunderous roar, he disappeared into the void, leaving nothing behind but a world that had been eaten whole.

In the end, there was nothing left but darkness and silence. But somewhere, deep in the void, Rex continued to eat, his hunger never sated, his appetite for destruction never quenched. And so the world remained, forever consumed by the dinosaur who ate the world.
