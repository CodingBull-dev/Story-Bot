In "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, the number 42 is famously referred to as the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything." The importance of this number is a running joke throughout the book and has become a cultural phenomenon.

Here's the conversation from the book where the number 42 is introduced:

"I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is."

"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything," howled Loonquawl.

"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, "but what actually is it?"

A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.

"Well, you know, it's just Everything ... Everything ..." offered Phouchg weakly.

"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means."

"That's amazing!" gasped Loonquawl. "That's absolutely amazing!" 

"Isn't it?" said Deep Thought. "But what do you want me to do about it?"

"You mean you can't tell us what the question actually is?" said Majikthise.

"Of course I can," said Deep Thought, "but it takes a little while. I'll have to think about it."

The importance of the number 42 lies in the fact that it is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. However, the question itself is never revealed, leaving readers to speculate and come up with their own interpretations. The number has since become a symbol of the absurdity and mystery of life.
