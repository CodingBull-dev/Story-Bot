Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, lived a little sparrow named Sparky. He was not as colorful or as radiant as the other birds, but he was content with his simple brown feathers.

One day, Sparky saw a beautiful peacock named Percy strutting around gleefully, showing off his stunning feathers.

Sparky admired Percy's beautiful plumage and wished he could be as colorful and striking. Sparky approached Percy and asked, "Percy, could you lend me some of your feathers? I want to be as beautiful as you."

Percy, who was kind-hearted, agreed to lend Sparky some of his feathers. With Percy's feathers attached, Sparky was transformed into a spectacular bird.

Sparky paraded around the forest, showing off his new feathers. The other birds admired him, and he basked in their attention. He felt proud and thrilled.

However, as time passed, Sparky's borrowed feathers started to lose their shine. They began to fall off one by one, revealing his simple brown feathers underneath. The other birds, realizing that the feathers were not Sparky's own, laughed at him.

Sparky felt embarrassed and sad. He returned to Percy and apologized for his foolishness. Percy comforted him, saying, "Sparky, you don't need to borrow someone else's feathers to be beautiful. You are unique in your own way."

Sparky realized that he had been wrong to covet someone else's beauty. He learned to appreciate his own feathers and be content with his uniqueness. From that day, he was happy just being himself.

And so, the tale of the bird with borrowed feathers ends, reminding us all to appreciate our own unique qualities and not to covet what others have.

THE END.
