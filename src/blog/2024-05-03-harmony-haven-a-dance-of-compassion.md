In the vibrant and colorful world of PINK's "Raise Your Glass" music video, the scene where the singer and her assistants play with calves is set in a whimsical farm sanctuary called Harmony Haven. This sanctuary is a haven for rescued animals of all kinds, where they can roam freely and live their lives in peace.

The video begins with PINK, known for her bold and rebellious spirit, arriving at Harmony Haven with her team of assistants. As they explore the sanctuary, they are greeted by a group of playful calves who have been rescued from a nearby farm. These calves, once destined for a life of confinement and exploitation, now find themselves in a place where they are loved and cared for.

PINK and her assistants immediately connect with the calves, their laughter filling the air as they playfully chase each other around the lush green fields. The singer, known for her love of animals and passion for standing up for what is right, is moved by the pure joy and innocence of the calves.

As the day goes on, PINK and her team join the calves in a joyous dance, celebrating the freedom and happiness that Harmony Haven represents. The scene is a powerful reminder of the importance of compassion and kindness towards all living beings, no matter their size or species.

Through this heartwarming moment in the music video, PINK not only showcases her playful and fun-loving side but also sends a powerful message about the beauty of empathy and the transformative power of love and acceptance.
