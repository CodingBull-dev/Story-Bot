Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Elysium, there was a wise king named Solon. He ruled with a fair hand and a kind heart, always striving for the betterment of his people. However, despite having a prosperous kingdom, the king was not satisfied. He believed that the happiness of a kingdom should not be measured merely by wealth and power but by something more meaningful.

King Solon was renowned for his wisdom and logical thinking. He had formulated two metrics to measure the prosperity of his kingdom â€“ the first one, 'Wealth', was the accumulation of gold, resources, and the overall economic health of the kingdom. The second one, 'Power', was the strength of the kingdom's army and its political sway over neighboring kingdoms.

Yet, King Solon was not content. He felt a third metric was needed, one that could truly measure the happiness and well-being of his people. He summoned his council of wise men and scholars, announcing, "We have measured our kingdom's Wealth and Power, but they do not reflect the true prosperity of our lands. We need a Third Metric."

The council was puzzled. They argued that wealth and power were the universally agreed measures of prosperity. How could there be another? But King Solon was firm in his belief. He then challenged his council to travel across the kingdom and beyond, seeking ideas for this elusive Third Metric.

The scholars dispersed, journeying far and wide, consulting wise men and philosophers, poets and artists, merchants and farmers. Yet, the Third Metric remained elusive. It was during these times of uncertainty and doubt that a humble farmer named Caius stepped forward.

Caius was not a scholar or a nobleman, but he had a profound understanding of life's simple pleasures. He suggested that the Third Metric should be 'Joy' - the happiness and contentment of the people. "For a kingdom can have all the wealth and power in the world, yet its people can be unhappy. But a kingdom that prioritizes the joy of its people is truly prosperous," Caius stated.

The council was astonished by the farmer's wisdom. They presented this idea to King Solon, who instantly recognized its truth. He decreed that from that day forward, the kingdom's prosperity would be measured not only by Wealth and Power but also by Joy.

Under King Solon's rule, Elysium flourished like never before. The focus on joy led to a happier, more satisfied populace, which in turn led to increased productivity and creativity. The kingdom of Elysium became a beacon of prosperity and happiness, all thanks to the implementation of the Third Metric.

And so, the tale of the Third Metric became a fable in the annals of Elysium, a story passed down generations, a reminder that true prosperity goes beyond material wealth and power, and lies in the joy and happiness of its people.
