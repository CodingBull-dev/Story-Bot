As the sun sets, painting the sky with hues of orange and purple, a child sits on the edge of a playground, swinging his legs back and forth. This child is you, years ago, full of dreams and aspirations, with a heart full of hope and a mind buzzing with curiosity. 

You, the adult, approach this child, your past self, with a sense of trepidation. You wonder, will this child be proud of the person you've become? Will he applaud the choices you've made, the paths you've taken, the life you've built?

You sit down next to the child, your younger self, and begin to share your story. You talk about the challenges you've faced, the victories you've celebrated, the losses you've mourned. You talk about the dreams you've chased, the ones you've achieved, and the ones you've had to let go. You talk about the love you've found, the hearts you've broken, and the lessons you've learned.

The child listens, his eyes wide with wonder and a touch of sadness. He sees the lines on your face, the weariness in your eyes, the strength in your voice. He sees the sacrifices you've made, the compromises you've accepted, the battles you've fought. He sees the person you've become, so different from the person he imagined, yet somehow, still the same.

And then, the child smiles. He reaches out, placing a small hand on your arm, and nods. He doesn't say a word, but his eyes speak volumes. They say, "I'm proud of you. I'm proud of the person you've become. I'm proud of the choices you've made, the paths you've taken, the life you've built."

The child you were applauds the adult you are. He applauds your resilience, your courage, your determination. He applauds your ability to adapt, to grow, to evolve. He applauds your willingness to learn, to change, to strive for better.

As the sun dips below the horizon, you stand up, feeling a sense of peace wash over you. You look at the child, your past self, one last time, and then you walk away, carrying his applause with you, a reminder of the journey you've taken, the person you've become, and the child you once were.
