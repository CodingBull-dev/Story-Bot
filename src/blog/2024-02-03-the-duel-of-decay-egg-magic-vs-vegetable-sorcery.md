The air was thick with anticipation as the two mages, Rose and Sara, faced each other in the grand arena. This was no ordinary duel; it was a battle where the very essence of their magical abilities was at stake. The crowd held its breath, knowing that the loser would suffer an unimaginable fate—stripped of their powers and subjected to eternal torment by the victor's magic.

Rose, with her egg magic, stood poised and confident. She had honed her spells to perfection, and as the duel commenced, she wasted no time. Chanting the incantation for her first spell, "Ovum Malleus Rapidus!" she performed the elaborate hand motions, and in an instant, a hard-boiled egg manifested, launching itself like a missile towards Sara. Its speed was unmatched, but Sara was prepared.

Dodging with a swift roll, Sara retaliated with her own chant, "Tomato Putridus Ictus!" A rancid tomato, dripping with decay, hurtled through the air towards Rose. The stench was overwhelming, but Rose's concentration was unbreakable. She summoned her second spell, "Ovum Fœtidus Rocket!" and with a flick of her wrist, a rotten egg burst forth, its vile odor clouding the area and making Sara gag, her next spell's chant faltered.

Sara, struggling to regain her composure, quickly cast "Cornus Explodens!" A massive cloud of popcorn exploded around her, creating a blinding barrier. Rose smirked, knowing her next move. She whispered the words, "Ovum Evasio!" Five large eggs erupted from the ground, and Rose's form vanished. The popcorn cloud settled, and Sara was left scanning the eggs, trying to predict where Rose might emerge.

In a daring move, Sara lunged forward to cast "Cucurbita Laqueus!" just as one of the eggs cracked open. A pumpkin began to form around the egg, but it was empty—Rose had outwitted her, appearing from another egg with a swift motion, chanting "Ovum Carcerem!" A giant egg materialized around Sara, trapping her momentarily. Sara's eyes widened as she realized her predicament, but she wasn't defeated yet.

With a muffled incantation, Sara's hands glowed green, and the pumpkin around her exploded into vines that cracked the egg prison. She was free, but her triumph was short-lived. Rose was already upon her, her hand outstretched, whispering the final and most fearsome spell, "Ovum Fœtidus Carcerem!"

Rose's touch was all that was needed. Sara, caught off guard, was enveloped in a gigantic rotten egg. The shell hardened instantly, trapping her inside. It began to fill with the fetid innards of a rotten egg, sealing her fate. Sara's muffled pleas were the last sounds she made before the rotten imprisonment spell took full effect, rendering her silent as the egg sealed shut.

The crowd erupted into cheers and gasps as Rose stood victorious. Sara, now trapped in a perpetual state of decay within the rotten egg, was defeated. Her magic would fade, and the torment of Rose's egg magic would be her eternal prison. As the arena cleared, Rose couldn't help but feel a twinge of sorrow for her fallen adversary. But the rules of the duel were clear, and the price of defeat was harsh in the world where magic was everything.
