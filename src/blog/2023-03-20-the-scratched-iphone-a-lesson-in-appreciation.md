Once upon a time, there was a hardworking colleague named Jason who loved his job more than anything else in the world. He was always the first one to arrive at the office and the last one to leave. He was a dedicated employee who always put his work first.

One day, Jason received an iPhone as a gift from his boss for his outstanding performance at work. He was thrilled to get the latest model and couldn't wait to use it. However, a few days after getting the phone, Jason accidentally dropped it and it got scratched. He was devastated and felt like he had let everyone down.

Jason thought he would have to spend a lot of money to repair the phone or buy a new one, but he couldn't afford it. He was worried that the damage to the phone would affect his ability to work and he would not be able to complete his daily tasks.

However, as time went by, Jason realized that the scratch on his phone did not affect his work at all. He could still make calls, send messages, and access all the apps he needed. He started to appreciate the phone for what it was and stopped worrying about the cosmetic damage.

In fact, the scratch on his phone made him realize that sometimes things don't have to be perfect to work properly. He learned to focus on the functionality of things rather than their appearance. This newfound perspective helped him become even more productive at work and he started to enjoy his job even more.

In the end, Jason realized that his scratched iPhone had taught him a valuable lesson. He had learned that it was important to focus on the things that really matter, and that sometimes imperfections can make us appreciate things even more.
