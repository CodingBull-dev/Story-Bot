Aiden sat in the backseat of the Wilson family's minivan, his heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and dread. The adoption process had been swift, and now here he was, being driven to his new home. He had longed for a family for as long as he could remember, but this was not what he had envisioned. 

The Wilsons' house was a charming two-story home with a white picket fence and a lush garden. As Aiden stepped out of the car, he was greeted by the sight of his new sisters, each with a distinct personality that he would soon come to know all too well.

Sarah, his new mother, was a kind-looking woman with a warm smile. "Welcome home, Aiden," she said, her voice gentle yet firm. "Or should I say, welcome home, baby boy."

Aiden's heart sank. He had hoped that the adoption agency had exaggerated the Wilsons' desire for a baby, but it seemed that was not the case. He was ushered inside, where he was introduced to his new sisters: Sophie, Jamie, and Lilly.

Sophie, the eldest at 20, was a whirlwind of energy, juggling school and her responsibilities at home. She gave Aiden a quick hug, then promptly popped a pacifier into his mouth. "You'll get used to it," she said with a wink, as if this was the most normal thing in the world.

Jamie, at 18, was the fashionista of the family. She was already eyeing Aiden with a gleam of excitement. "Oh, you're going to look so cute in the outfits I picked out for you," she said, clapping her hands together. Aiden cringed inwardly, knowing that his wardrobe was about to take a very pink and frilly turn.

Then there was Lilly, the same age as Aiden but worlds apart in demeanor. She was the picture of innocence when others were around, but Aiden quickly learned that she relished her newfound power over him. "Hi, baby brother," she cooed, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness. "We're going to have so much fun together."

Aiden's room was a nursery, complete with a crib, a mobile, and walls painted in pastel colors. His clothes were all baby girl items, from frilly dresses to onesies adorned with lace. He felt his face flush with embarrassment as he realized the extent of his predicament.

The days that followed were a blur of humiliating experiences. Mealtimes were spent in a highchair, where Sophie would feed him with a spoon, often making airplane noises to coax him into opening his mouth. Jamie delighted in dressing him up, taking countless photos to share with her friends. Lilly, meanwhile, took every opportunity to baby-talk him, especially when they had visitors.

Despite the humiliation, there were moments when Aiden saw glimpses of genuine care from his new family. Sarah would tuck him in at night, reading him bedtime stories with a tenderness that made him feel almost safe. Sophie would sometimes sit with him, talking about her day as if he were a confidant rather than a baby. Even Jamie and Lilly, in their own ways, seemed to enjoy having him around.

But Aiden couldn't shake the feeling of being trapped. He longed for the freedom to be himself, to be treated as the teenager he was rather than an overgrown infant. Every day, he plotted his escape, dreaming of a life where he could be just Aiden, not "baby Aiden."

Yet, as time went on, he found himself questioning his resolve. The Wilsons, for all their quirks, had given him something he had never truly had before: a family. And while the situation was far from ideal, Aiden began to wonder if perhaps, in time, he could find a way to carve out his own identity within this unconventional household.

Only time would tell if Aiden would find the courage to break free or if he would learn to embrace his new life as the Wilsons' baby boy.
