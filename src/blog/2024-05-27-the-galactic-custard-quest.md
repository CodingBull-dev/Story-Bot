  prompt: "Write a story about aliens who visit earth and fall in love with custard, they love chocolate custard but the vanilla yellow custard is by far their biggest love. Whilst exploring they come across a cafe, they sneak in whilst the door is open minding peoples feet and make their way to the kitchen and this is where they first see the custard\r\n\r\n\r\nThey plan on taking some home but they're not sure how to transport it because they're only several millimetres tall and their ship is also small, roughly 5inches so nothing will fit"

Captain Zorblat and Lieutenant Fleepa were on a mission unlike any they had ever embarked upon before. The tiny, millimeter-sized aliens had journeyed from the planet Zyllok in search of novel experiences and new tastes. Their spacecraft, a sleek, glittering marvel of Zyllokian engineering, was only five inches long but equipped with the latest in stealth and navigational technology. On their most recent scouting trip, they had landed in a charming little town on Earth, known locally as Treeton.

Treeton seemed quaint enough, with its cobblestone streets and friendly townsfolk. The two explorers darted and fluttered about, hidden in the shadows, until a tantalizing aroma led them to a humble cafe on Main Street called "Sweet Haven."

The doors of Sweet Haven swung open, and Zorblat and Fleepa seized the opportunity to sneak inside, skittering past human feet with the agility and speed only millimeter-sized beings possessed. Their keen senses led them directly to the kitchen, where the source of the enchanting scent awaited.

There in the kitchen, giant metal pans brimming with custard sat cooling on a countertop. Zorblat and Fleepa approached cautiously, their excitement mounting with each step. As they neared the custard, their antennae twitched with delight.

"Look at this one!" exclaimed Fleepa, pointing to a pan of creamy yellow custard that glistened under the kitchen lights. "It looks like liquid sunshine!"

"Yes, but what about this one?" countered Zorblat, motioning to a bowl filled with rich, dark chocolate custard. "It smells divine!"

Unable to resist the lure of the custards, they sampled the delights. They started with the chocolate custard, marveling at its smooth texture and rich, decadent flavor. But when they tasted the vanilla custard, their tiny hearts nearly burst with joy. It was a symphony of sweetness that defied their wildest imaginations.

"We must take some of this back to Zyllok," Zorblat declared, his tiny eyes wide with resolve. "Our people need to experience this wonder."

"But how?" wondered Fleepa. "Our ship is small, and we're even smaller. Transporting this much custard is impossible."

The two aliens pondered their dilemma. Around them, the kitchen staff buzzed, oblivious to the minute visitors. Suddenly, Zorblat's eyes lit up.

"What if we took just a sample? Enough to synthesize and replicate it back home?"

Fleepa slapped her antennae together in agreement. "Brilliant idea! But how do we carry even a small portion?"

Looking around the kitchen, they spotted a fallen thimble under a table. Zorblat and Fleepa scurried over and managed to roll the thimble towards the custard. With much effort, they heaved it up, a drop of the precious vanilla custard dribbling down its side and into the thimble.

As they stood proudly by their filled thimble, the kitchen door swung open again, and a human child darted in, dropping a small, clear plastic bead from a game. The bead rolled towards the thimble, both Zorblat and Fleepa had to scramble to avoid being squished.

An idea struck them. “That bead!” exclaimed Fleepa. “It's perfect!”

Quickly, the two aliens maneuvered the bead next to the thimble. With great precision, they poured the tiny scoop of custard into the bead and sealed it.

Their hearts pounding with triumph, Zorblat and Fleepa rolled the bead back to their hidden spacecraft. They loaded the precious cargo and, with a flick of Zorblat's wrist, the ship’s engines hummed to life.

As they soared back into the cosmos, the precious bead of custard safely stored aboard their tiny vessel, they glanced back at Earth with gratitude.

"Our people will sing songs of this day," said Zorblat.

"And we’ll return to Earth,” added Fleepa gleefully. “There are surely more culinary wonders awaiting us!"

Little did Sweet Haven know, their humble kitchen had hosted the beginning of an intergalactic love affair with custard that would change the gastronomical landscape of Zyllok forever.
