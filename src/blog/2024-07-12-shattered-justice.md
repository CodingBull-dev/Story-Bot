  prompt: "An African-American Black Lives Matter male supporter is falsely accussed of attempted murder of a police officer near a fight during a protest in a New Mexico town. The officer is in a coma. He was near the fight, but quickly left when it started and did not know it ended badly. While he have a lot of support and the evidence is minimal, he was found guilty. No happy ending, no second looks,  no hope. Per few paragraphs, they are separated by calender dates. The events took place on May 19, 2020 to March 23, 2024"
