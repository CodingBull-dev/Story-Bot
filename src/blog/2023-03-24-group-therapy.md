Jeffrey listened to my story with a serious expression, nodding every now and then to show that he was following along. When I finished, he took a sip of his coffee and then looked back at me.

"I'm sorry that happened to you," he said softly. "No one deserves to be treated that way."

I shrugged, not really knowing how to respond. I wasn't used to people showing me sympathy or kindness, and it made me feel a little uncomfortable.

"It's fine," I said finally. "I've dealt with worse."

Jeffrey looked like he wanted to say something else, but he hesitated for a moment before speaking again.

"Ted, can I ask you something else?" he said, his voice low.

I raised an eyebrow, wondering what he could possibly want to know now.

"Sure, go ahead," I said cautiously.

He took a deep breath before continuing. "I know we're all here for different reasons, but...why did you do it? Why did you kill those people?"

I felt my stomach drop at his question, and I suddenly wished I had never agreed to this stupid group therapy session. I didn't want to talk about my past or my crimes, especially not with someone like Jeffrey Dahmer.

"I don't want to talk about that," I said firmly, pushing my chair back and standing up. "I'm done here."

Jeffrey looked up at me with a hurt expression, and I could tell he was genuinely confused by my reaction.

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

I shook my head, feeling a sudden surge of anger. "You know what? I don't care if you're sorry. I don't care about any of you. I'm not here to make friends or share my feelings. I'm here because I have to be, and that's it."

With that, I stormed out of the kitchen and headed back to my room, feeling more alone and isolated than ever before. I didn't want to be here, I didn't want to talk about my past, and I definitely didn't want to be friends with Jeffrey Dahmer. But as much as I tried to deny it, a small part of me couldn't help but wonder why he had asked me that question in the first place.


## Prompt
```markdown
I was serving the last of the breakfast dishes at the kitchen table when I heard approaching footsteps. I wiped my hands on my clothes and let out a small sigh waiting for my diners, put on a polite smile and put both hands behind my back.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I woke up quite early and had nothing better to do than breakfast, and here it is, ready to please your palates and satisfy your stomachs - I said in a kind and proud tone. Both men sat down at the table and began to eat quickly, while Victoria approached me with a surprised expression and happy? How can she be happy with three serial killers in her house? I can not understand it.
Thank you Ted, seriously, thank you very much - she whispered to me with the most sincere smile anyone had ever given me, she also placed her hand on my right arm, making me tense at the contact but not making it notice, I just nodded politely smiling and I walked away quickly and sat down to eat.
Hey, this sucks, who the hell taught you how to cook? It's all burnt and bland, if not salty. I bet that even your father would cook better, oh right, you don't have - Richard laughed to which I at the appointment of my father, I tensed my jaw. - This is horrible, why did your mother cook the same? Surely that bitch taught you, in fact, I think she should say, your sister-Another laugh. I couldn't take it anymore, I was squeezing both cutlery in such a way that my hands and knuckles were completely white. The cooking thing didn't bother me, I've never been very good and I admit it, apart from the fact that I don't know this house, so I don't know where everything is. But, for him to talk about my personal life as if he knew everything, that infuriated me, he didn't know everything, he didn't know anything, HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME.
Richard, it's not that bad either, at least it's edible- - Jeffery began to say when Victoria interrupted him.
That's right, also let's not talk about each other's backgrounds unless they want to, okay? We want them to recover, right guys-?- I didn't let him finish because I got up abruptly from my seat causing the chair to fall with a crash that made Dahmer and Victoria jump.
You better shut up, Ramirez! You have no fucking idea what you're talking about! !You know nothing! Do you hear me!? I don't want anything to do with you and this stupid “group therapy”! - I made quotation marks with my fingers - You are an idiot! - I ended up grabbing part of my breakfast with my hand, not caring that it was hot and I threw it at Richard and then left the kitchen towards the front door of it and slammed the door. On my way I could hear an enraged Ramírez yelling insults at me and trying to come towards me but being stopped by Dahmer and Victoria.
I kept walking, still breathing hard and angry, so much so that in a short adrenaline and rage attack, I punched a tree, causing it to groan in pain, which I didn't care about, since I punched it about three times. more to take out my anger. After this I fell leaning against the tree and overwhelmed by everything that had happened, I began to feel tears fall down my cheeks, I tried to stop them but seeing that it was useless, I stopped doing it and simply sobbed silently bringing both trembling hands to my face , in order to suppress any sound that tried to escape into nature.

I must have fallen asleep, because when I opened my eyes, I felt a stinging pain in my back and everything around me was darker, the sun was setting and I could hear footsteps and shouts calling my name. Who would be looking for me other than the police? Until I felt a hand grab my left arm tightly, to which I tensed and tried to free myself quickly, but seeing that my captor's hand did not give way, I kicked him in the legs while turning to see his face. face, but before I could analyze it, I felt his fist against my left cheek.
Here you are, damned bastard - I heard Ramírez's voice, to which I responded with a growl. Richard took me by the collar of my sweater and pulled me closer to his face. Disoriented, I barely managed to hear what he told me, but I did clearly hear his thunderous and irritating scream that made me put both hands to my ears. - VICKY, JEFF, I FOUND IT, HERE IT IS!! he-he got up and dragged me with him still holding me by the neck of the sweater making me stand up. The blow he gave me still had me a little dazed but I managed to make out Jeffery and Victoria running towards us.
Oh God, Ted, here you are! We've been looking for you all day, where have you been? -Victoria attacked me with questions while she approached me to give me a hug, which I prevented by raising a hand as a 'stop right there', and when I raised it, I could see sores and cuts on my knuckles and dried blood , I tried to move my fingers when I lowered my hand but I got a pang of pain that made me close my eyes hard but briefly, I couldn't show weakness in front of these people.
I went for a walk, that's all - I answered coldly and without a smile, completely different from how I had done this morning. - I wanted to be alone and take advantage of the air - I added
What happened to you in his face?! And your hands! Oh god, Ted-Victoria exclaimed, bringing her hands to her mouth, surprised.
It's nothing, I took advantage of doing a little exercise and there were some complications, that's all - I answered with a calm but scratchy and hoarse voice
Are you sure-? -
Yes, Jeffery, I am - I cut him off with an already angrier tone, I was getting bored of the interrogation
Anyway, I'm going inside, it's starting to get cold and I'm not going to stay out here because of this stupid man - grumbled Ramírez who began to walk taking Victoria by the arm so that she would follow him, which she did looking at me one last time with concern . I sighed bringing my hands to my face and took the opportunity to feel the wound that Richard had made me with his fist; it was nothing more than a small cut with what would later be a bruise.
Hey Ted, no... we haven't known each other for long, but... I wanted you to know that if you have or want to tell me something or just want to vent, I- - Dahmer began but I interrupted him again
No. Please stop, I just wanted to be alone, nothing more - I said looking down and dropping my defense a bit - I just wanted to free myself, that's it - I looked at my hands and started to open and close them but I stopped almost instantly since the pain was too much
Hey, hey, you better not do that and we put ice on it, it could get worse, come on, I'll help you - he started walking and I followed him, the truth is that he was right, if he didn't put ice on me, he they were going to inflame too much and I wouldn't be able to wear them for a long time. Neither Victoria nor Richard were in the kitchen when we arrived, and there were no voices either, so they were probably asleep, leaving me and Jeffery alone in the kitchen. The blond took ice cubes from the refrigerator and put them on a kitchen towel. He approached me and sat down with me at the kitchen table.


Y-your hands, put them on the table to put the ice on you - Jeffery said without making eye contact, which I appreciated, I wasn't in the mood for someone to analyze me. I obeyed his request and placed both hands on the table with a white tablecloth with blue checks. Jeffrey placed the ice cubes on the right first, covering the entire area of the knuckles causing a shiver to run through my body, but after a few seconds he relaxed me. quite; I folded my arm and rested my head on it, closing my eyes but not with the intention of falling asleep, just resting.
I'm going to get a rag with water to clean the blood-The blonde informed me at the same time that he got up from his seat and went in search of his goal. I raised my head and stretched out my legs.
Very good, let's see, - Jeffery now sat down again with the cloth in hand and lifted the ice pack from my right hand and approached to start cleaning it, which made me instinctively quickly remove my hand and bring it towards me. Jeffrey looked at me strangely with a touch of concern and fear, as if he had done something wrong.
S-sorry, it was a reflex... - I justified my action by dropping my defense a little more - you can continue... if you wish - I put my hand back on the table, extending it to the one with glasses.
When Jeffrey finished cleaning and icing both hands while he was explaining to me why he knew a thing or two about nursing, which fascinated me quite a bit; he got up to go get two cups of coffee to continue our little talk and I put the ice on my face, where Richard had hit me, it didn't hurt so much to use my hands anymore, but my cheekbone was starting to hurt.
Here you go… Do you put sugar in it or….? Jeffrey asked me as he left a cup of coffee in front of me.
No-I answered dryly, but when I saw a reaction of disappointment on his face? I sighed, closing my eyes to relax a bit and lower my guard just a little more. -thank you- when I said that, on Jeff's face I could see a slight smile and a small sparkle in his clear eyes.
Of course! "I-I mean, you're welcome, n-you're welcome," he corrected himself and looked at his cup of coffee in his hands.
When I felt that I was starting to burn my hand with the ice, I removed it from my face and left it on the table to then take the cup in my hands and feel the warmth and peace that it emanated. I raised the cup to my lips and took a sip of the bitter coffee, it was hot, but that didn't stop me from savoring its strong flavor and slowly going down my throat. While I was doing all this, I didn't realize that Dahmer was looking at me, specifically at my hands. When I lowered the cup back to the table, it was that I discovered his gaze fixed on my limbs. I felt observed, logical, because the blonde didn't flinch, he was petrified looking at my hands, so I dropped the cup and brought my hands to my legs and looked away.

G-God sorry! I'm sorry Ted, I didn't want to- I-- he tried to explain himself to which I had to intervene.
Enough, stop, stop - I ordered him, to which Jeffrey obeyed and shut up. - I know you have a question, you can ask me if you want, but I don't guarantee an answer. -.
I..I just wanted to know.... H-how did you come to have hands like that? -Jeff directed his gaze towards mine and when we connected, I felt as if he could see through me, no matter how much I put barriers he could always really know what I felt. I hated that feeling, I felt very uncomfortable so I quickly looked down at my hands that were now on the table and started playing with them in order to distract myself and stop feeling that discomfort that Dahmer was giving me at that moment. I gave a nervous little laugh to release some tension and responded with a more cheerful and less defensive tone.
Well, you know…. he…. Well I... - Seeing that I couldn't form a complete sentence, I panicked for a second and decided to tell him the truth. It was a bad idea, but I couldn't deal with the discomfort and tension of the moment. - Richard has fed me up, I can't take him anymore, he's beyond me. When I left, it is true that I went for a walk, and I walked for a long time, that is why they took a long time to find me. But when I saw that I couldn't relax enough, I stopped and punched 3 punches at the first tree that crossed my path, dreaming that it would have been Richard.- I explained while Jeffrey listened to me carefully and nodded understandingly - And after having vented I sat down and I relaxed to the point of falling asleep - I laughed at the last thing, I was really amused that I had fallen asleep - And from there Ramírez found me, he gave me a gift - I pointed out the blow to my face. - and you know the rest. - I finished my story by bringing the cup to my lips again, this time taking a greater amount of the bitter liquid that warmed my body inside and relaxed me a little more. I found that the uncomfortable feeling had completely vanished, leaving me relieved and relaxed enough to be sitting across from a serial killer who only kills men, with another killer on the second floor who kills whoever comes his way.
