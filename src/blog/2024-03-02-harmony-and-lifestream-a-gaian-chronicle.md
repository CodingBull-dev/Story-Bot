In the hybrid timeline of "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" and "Final Fantasy VII," the world is a place where the magic of friendship and the power of the Lifestream intertwine, creating a history rich with wonder and conflict. 

**The Dawn of Harmony and the Lifestream**

In the earliest days, as the three pony tribes—the Earth Ponies, Pegasi, and Unicorns—united to create the fiery Friendship Heart, their combined magic and harmony warmed the world, ending the eternal winter wrought by the Windigos. At the same time, on another part of the planet, the Cetra, an ancient and wise race, fought back the alien entity known as JENOVA, sealing it away deep within the Northern Crater. 

The Friendship Heart, a crystalline manifestation of the ponies' unity, became a beacon of harmony, while the Lifestream, the planet's lifeblood, flowed strong, nurturing the world and keeping JENOVA at bay. These two forces of magic began to mix, creating a unique energy that affected the evolution of life across the planet.

**The Age of Discord and the Jenova War**

Centuries passed, and the world saw the rise of Discord, a draconequus who reveled in chaos. As Discord toyed with the land of Equestria, bending it to his whims, the planet also faced the Jenova War, where the Cetra battled the remnants of JENOVA's influence. The Friendship Heart's power waned under Discord's influence, and the Lifestream was tainted by the darkness of JENOVA.

A group of brave Cetra, known as the "Harmonious Ones," sought the Friendship Heart, believing in its power to restore balance. With the help of a unicorn mage whose magic resonated with the Lifestream, they defeated Discord and re-sealed JENOVA, restoring peace for a time.

**The Rise of Shinra and the Princesses**

The Shinra Electric Power Company rose to prominence, harnessing the Lifestream's energy through Mako reactors, unaware of the delicate balance they were disrupting. In Equestria, two alicorn sisters, Celestia and Luna, took the throne, vowing to protect the Friendship Heart and the harmony of their land.

As Shinra's influence spread, so too did tales of Equestria's magic. Shinra, ever hungry for power, sought to understand the Friendship Heart, sending scouts to the land of ponies. Meanwhile, the Princesses, sensing the disturbance in the Lifestream, began to study the ancient Cetra texts to better protect their realm.

**The Nightmare and the Calamity**

When Princess Luna transformed into Nightmare Moon, her bitterness and anger threatened to summon the Windigos once more. Celestia, with a heavy heart, used the Elements of Harmony to banish her sister to the moon, an act that echoed across the planet, causing a surge in the Lifestream.

This surge awakened JENOVA, who had been dormant since the Jenova War. The planet, sensing the return of the Calamity, created a Weapon—massive creatures designed to protect the Lifestream. The Weapons awoke, and their emergence was felt even in the distant land of Equestria.

**The Advent of Sephiroth and the Return of Harmony**

Years later, Sephiroth, a product of Shinra's experiments involving JENOVA's cells, discovered the truth about his origins. His descent into madness coincided with the return of Princess Luna, now reformed as Nightmare Moon. The Mane Six, a group of six ponies destined for greatness, used the Elements of Harmony to defeat Nightmare Moon, restoring her to Princess Luna just as Sephiroth summoned Meteor to destroy the planet.

The Friendship Heart, now recognized as a counterpart to the Lifestream, pulsed with energy, aiding the planet's defenses. The Mane Six, alongside heroes from across the world, including Cloud Strife and his allies, worked together to stop Sephiroth and save the planet from Meteor.

**The Harmony of Gaia**

With Sephiroth defeated and the threat of Meteor averted, the heroes of both worlds recognized the importance of unity. The Friendship Heart and the Lifestream, once separate forces, were now acknowledged as two parts of the same whole—the life essence of the planet, Gaia.

The ponies of Equestria and the people of Gaia learned to coexist, blending their magic and technology, their cultures and dreams. Together, they faced future threats, knowing that the magic of friendship and the power of the Lifestream were intertwined, forever protecting the harmony of their world.
