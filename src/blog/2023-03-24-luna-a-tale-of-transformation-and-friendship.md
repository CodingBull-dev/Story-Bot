Once upon a time, there was a curious little cat named Luna. Luna loved to explore the world around her, sniffing out new scents and chasing after butterflies. One day, as she was wandering through the woods, she stumbled upon a mysterious old woman who lived in a small cottage. 

Luna was fascinated by the old woman and would visit her every day, curling up on her lap and listening to her stories. The old woman always seemed to understand Luna, even though she only meowed in response. 

One day, as Luna was sitting on the old woman's lap, something strange began to happen. She felt a strange sensation in her body, like she was shifting and changing. Before she knew it, Luna had transformed into a human, with cat ears and a tail. 

The old woman was surprised and amazed by the transformation, but she was also delighted. She took it upon herself to teach Luna how to speak and act like a human. Luna was a quick learner, and soon she was able to hold conversations and express herself in words.

As the weeks turned into months, Luna and the old woman grew closer and closer. They would spend their days together, drinking tea and watching the birds outside the window. Luna loved to snuggle up with the old woman and listen to her stories, feeling grateful for the opportunity to connect with her on a deeper level.

But one day, the old woman became very ill. Luna was by her side, caring for her and doing everything she could to make her comfortable. Sadly, the old woman passed away, leaving Luna heartbroken and alone.

In her grief, Luna assumed her cat form once again. But she knew that she had one last duty to perform â€“ to guide the old woman to the afterlife. Luna led the old woman's spirit to the other side, and there they were reunited once again.

Together, Luna and the old woman watched over the world, as the cat girl's humanlike form faded away, content in the knowledge that they would always be together, in this life and the next.


## Prompt
```markdown
Write a story about a cat that became a human. She still has cat like ears and a tail, but otherwise she is very humanlike (in her 20s). She learns to speak from an old grandma who she used to visit as a cat.
The cat girl takes care of the granny and they like to drink tea and watch birds fly.
In the end, the granny dies and the cat assumes her cat form again. She leads the old woman to the after life, and they are very happy together.
