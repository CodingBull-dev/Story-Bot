In the beginning, the packs of wild dogs were just a minor nuisance in the cities. They would scavenge for food and occasionally attack small animals or even humans. But as time went on, their numbers grew and their behavior became more aggressive.

Soon, the packs of wild dogs began to organize themselves into larger groups, with alpha dogs leading the way. They would roam the streets at night, taking over entire neighborhoods and driving out any humans who dared to challenge them.

At first, the authorities tried to control the situation by capturing or killing the dogs. But their efforts were in vain, as the packs were too numerous and too cunning to be defeated.

As the years went by, the packs of wild dogs grew stronger and more organized. They began to take over entire cities, driving out the human population and establishing their own territories.

At first, the remaining humans tried to resist the dogs, but they were no match for their strength and ferocity. Soon, the packs of wild dogs controlled most of the major cities, and the humans were forced to flee to the countryside.

As the years went by, the packs of wild dogs continued to expand their territories, until they controlled all of the major cities in the world. The humans were forced to live in small, isolated communities, constantly on guard against the dogs.

In the end, the packs of wild dogs had become the rulers of the world, and the humans were reduced to mere survivors in a world that was no longer theirs.
