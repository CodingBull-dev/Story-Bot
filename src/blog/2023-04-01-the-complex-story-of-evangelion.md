The story of Evangelion is a complex and multifaceted one, spanning across multiple iterations including the original anime series, a series of movies, and a manga. At its heart, the story is a coming-of-age tale centered around a young boy named Shinji Ikari, who is tasked with piloting a giant mecha known as an "Eva" to defend humanity against mysterious alien beings known as Angels.

The story begins in the year 2015, more than a decade after a global catastrophe known as the Second Impact. Shinji, who has been estranged from his father Gendo, is summoned to Tokyo-3 by the organization NERV to pilot Eva Unit-01. Along with fellow pilots Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu, Shinji must battle the Angels to protect humanity and unravel the mysteries of the Evas and the organization behind them.

As the story progresses, it becomes apparent that there is more to NERV and the Evas than initially meets the eye. Gendo, the commander of NERV, is revealed to be planning an event known as "Instrumentality" in which humanity will merge into a single entity, a plan which involves using the Evas to initiate a new impact on the planet. Additionally, it is revealed that the Evas are not just machines, but are actually living beings known as "Apostles," and that they are linked to both the Angels and the mysterious "Spear of Longinus."

As Shinji struggles to come to terms with his role in NERV and his relationship with his father, he also grapples with the moral implications of NERV's mission and the true nature of the Angels. The story takes a dark turn when Asuka's mental state deteriorates and she is attacked by a group of mass-produced Evas, leaving her in a coma. In the final battle against the Angels, Shinji is forced to confront his own inner demons and ultimately decides to reject Instrumentality, ending the threat to humanity but at great personal cost.

The story continues in the subsequent movies, which offer alternate versions of events from the original anime. The first movie, "Death and Rebirth," condenses the events of the anime and concludes with the beginning of Instrumentality. The second movie, "The End of Evangelion," offers an alternate ending to the series in which humanity is obliterated in a cataclysmic event known as Third Impact, with Shinji and Asuka the only survivors in a barren wasteland.

Overall, the story of Evangelion is a rich and complex exploration of themes such as existentialism, loneliness, and identity, told through the lens of a futuristic sci-fi epic. Through its many twists and turns, the story leaves a lasting impact on its audience and remains a beloved classic of the anime genre.
