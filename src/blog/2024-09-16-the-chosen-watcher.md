I couldn't believe my eyes. The sight before me was something out of a dream, or perhaps a nightmare. The sky was painted in hues of purple and gold, with streaks of green lightning dancing across the horizon. In the distance, a colossal figure, shimmering with an otherworldly glow, moved slowly but deliberately towards our town. I shouted to my wife, "Do you see it?"

She looked up from her book, her eyes heavy with the fatigue of a long day. "What?" she asked, her voice tinged with concern and confusion.

I pointed frantically towards the window, my heart pounding in my chest. "Out there! That... thing! It's coming this way!"

She walked over to the window, her expression shifting from curiosity to sadness. "I don't see anything, honey," she said softly, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. "Are you sure you're feeling alright?"

I stared at her, my mind racing. How could she not see it? The figure was enormous, its presence impossible to ignore. I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that maybe, just maybe, I was the only one who could see it.

"Maybe it's just my imagination," I muttered, trying to convince myself more than her. But deep down, I knew it was real. I could feel its presence, its intent. It was coming for something, or someone.

That night, sleep eluded me. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying the events of the evening over and over in my mind. My wife slept soundly beside me, her breathing steady and calm. I envied her peace, her ignorance of the looming threat.

The next morning, I decided to investigate. I couldn't just ignore what I had seen. I drove to the edge of town, where the figure had first appeared. The landscape was eerily quiet, the usual sounds of nature replaced by an unsettling silence.

As I walked through the fields, I noticed something strange. The grass was scorched in places, as if touched by an intense heat. The air felt thick, almost electric. I followed the trail of scorched earth, my heart pounding with each step.

Eventually, I reached a clearing. In the center stood a massive stone structure, unlike anything I had ever seen. It was covered in strange symbols that seemed to pulse with a faint light. I approached cautiously, my instincts screaming at me to turn back.

As I reached out to touch the stone, a voice echoed in my mind. "You have been chosen," it said, its tone both commanding and gentle. "Prepare yourself."

I stumbled back, my mind reeling. Chosen for what? I had no answers, only more questions. But one thing was clear: my life, and the lives of those around me, were about to change forever.

I returned home, my thoughts racing. I couldn't tell my wife, not yet. She wouldn't understand, and I didn't want to worry her. Instead, I decided to keep a close watch on the stone structure, to see if anything else happened.

Days turned into weeks, and the figure did not reappear. But the feeling of being watched, of being on the brink of something monumental, never left me. I knew that whatever was coming, I had to be ready.

And so, I waited.
