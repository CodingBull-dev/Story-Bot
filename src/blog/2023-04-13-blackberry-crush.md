Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a rom com in the style of a Blackberry Messenger conversation between two teenagers set in the year 2009:

---

It's a typical Friday night, and 16-year-old Emily is at home, scrolling through her Blackberry Messenger contacts. She notices that her crush, 17-year-old Jake, is online and decides to message him.

Emily: Hey Jake, what's up?

Jake: Not much, just chilling. What about you?

Emily: Same here. I'm just bored at home. What are you up to tonight?

Jake: I was thinking of going out with some friends. Maybe catch a movie or something. You?

Emily: That sounds fun! I don't really have any plans. Maybe we could all go together?

Jake: Sure, that sounds great. I'll let you know the details once we figure out what we're doing.

Emily's heart races as she reads Jake's message. She can't believe she's going to hang out with him and his friends. She spends the rest of the night getting ready, picking out the perfect outfit and doing her hair and makeup.

Finally, Jake messages her with the details.

Jake: Hey, so we're going to see a movie at the mall. Meet us outside the theater at 7?

Emily: Sounds good! Can't wait to see you there.

Emily arrives at the mall early, trying to play it cool as she waits for Jake and his friends. When they finally arrive, she can't help but feel nervous as she greets them.

Jake: Hey Emily, glad you could make it!

Emily: Hey Jake, thanks for inviting me.

As they walk to the theater, Emily and Jake chat and laugh, feeling more and more comfortable around each other. They sit next to each other during the movie, and Emily can't help but feel a spark between them.

After the movie, they all grab some food at the food court, and Emily and Jake continue to talk and joke around. As the night comes to an end, Emily can't help but feel disappointed that it's over.

Emily: Thanks for a great night, Jake. We should do this again sometime.

Jake: Definitely. I had a lot of fun with you tonight.

Emily: Me too. Maybe we could hang out again next weekend?

Jake: Sounds good to me. I'll message you during the week and we can figure something out.

Emily goes to bed that night with a huge smile on her face, feeling like she's on top of the world. She can't wait to see where things go with Jake, and she knows that Blackberry Messenger will be her go-to app for messaging him from now on.
