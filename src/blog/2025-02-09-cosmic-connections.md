  prompt: "apollo doesn't go out very often. if he wanted to unwind, he would spend time at home with his cat rather than head to an obnoxiously loud bar. yet, somehow, he let himself get dragged here by his co-worker and friend athena.\r\n\r\nhe knew it wasn't a good idea, but he's feeling particularly remorseful as he sits at the bar alone, watching out of the corner of his eye as athena, tipsy and red, engages in a flirty conversation with some flattered lady on the dance floor. at least someone is having fun. Apollo sits at the bar table alone until a girl sits at the bar a couple of seats away from him. They make eye contact once before looking away. It was a strange feelingâ€¦A feeling that made them feel like there was connection even if they were strangers"

Apollo shifted uncomfortably on the bar stool, swirling the ice cubes in his drink as he stole another glance at the girl. She was engrossed in her phone, her fingers dancing over the screen, but there was an air of restlessness about her, as if she too felt out of place amidst the chaos of the bar. The thumping bass of the music seemed to fade into the background, and Apollo found himself wondering what had brought her here.

He took a sip of his drink, trying to muster the courage to say something. The girl tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, and their eyes met once more. This time, she offered a tentative smile, and Apollo felt a warmth spread through him. He returned the smile, feeling oddly comforted by the simple exchange.

"Not your scene either?" he ventured, his voice barely audible over the music.

She looked up, surprised, and then nodded with a wry smile. "Not really. My friends insisted it would be fun. I'm starting to think they have a different definition of fun."

Apollo chuckled, nodding in understanding. "Same here. I think I'd rather be at home with my cat."

Her eyes lit up with interest. "You have a cat? What's its name?"

"Orion," Apollo replied, relaxing a bit. "He's a bit of a diva, but good company."

She laughed, a genuine, melodic sound that made Apollo's heart skip a beat. "I have a dog, Luna. She's the queen of the house."

"Orion and Luna," Apollo mused. "Sounds like a cosmic pair."

The girl grinned, and Apollo felt the tension of the evening begin to dissipate. They talked about their pets, their favorite books, and the little things that made them happy. The conversation flowed easily, like they had known each other for much longer than a few minutes.

As the night wore on, Apollo found himself grateful for Athena's insistence. He glanced over to see her still engaged in animated conversation, and he made a mental note to thank her later. For now, he was content to sit there, sharing stories and laughter with a stranger who felt like a friend.

Eventually, the girl glanced at her watch and sighed. "I should probably head home. Luna will be wondering where I am."

Apollo nodded, feeling a pang of disappointment. "Yeah, I should check on Orion too."

They exchanged numbers, promising to meet up again, perhaps in a quieter setting. As she left the bar, Apollo watched her go, a small smile playing on his lips. Maybe stepping out of his comfort zone wasn't such a bad idea after all.
