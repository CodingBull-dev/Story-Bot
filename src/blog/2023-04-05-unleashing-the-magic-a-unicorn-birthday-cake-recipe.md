Sure, here's a recipe for a delicious unicorn themed birthday cake:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups whole milk
- Food coloring (pink, purple, blue)
- 1 batch of vanilla buttercream frosting (recipe below)
- Edible glitter and rainbow sprinkles for decoration

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, beat in the vanilla extract.

5. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, do not overmix.

6. Divide the batter into three equal parts. Color each part with pink, purple, and blue food coloring.

7. Pour the batter into the prepared pans, alternating the colors to create a marbled effect.

8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

9. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing them from the pans and placing them on a wire rack to cool completely.

10. While the cakes are cooling, make the vanilla buttercream frosting (recipe below).

11. Once the cakes have cooled, place one cake layer on a cake stand or plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top.

12. Place the second cake layer on top of the frosting, and spread another layer of frosting on top.

13. Place the final cake layer on top of the frosting, and spread a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake (this is called a crumb coat).

14. Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to set the crumb coat.

15. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread a final layer of frosting over the entire cake. Use a piping bag to pipe swirls of frosting around the edges of the cake.

16. Decorate the cake with edible glitter and rainbow sprinkles to make it look like a magical unicorn!

Vanilla Buttercream Frosting:

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2-3 tbsp whole milk

1. In a large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

2. Gradually mix in the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, until well combined.

3. Mix in the vanilla extract.

4. Add the milk one tablespoon at a time until the frosting reaches your desired consistency.

Enjoy your magical unicorn birthday cake!
