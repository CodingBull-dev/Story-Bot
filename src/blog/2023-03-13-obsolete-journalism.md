I still remember the days when journalism was a noble profession, where writers like me would spend hours chasing leads, speaking to sources, and then putting together a story that would inform the public. But that was before the machines took over. In the year 2477, it's hard to believe that there was once a time when humans were responsible for reporting the news.

I can't say I'm thrilled about being a journalist in this day and age, where we're basically just glorified editors. We input the data gathered by machines, double-checking facts and figures, and then putting it together into a readable format. There's no creative spark, no passion, no soul in this kind of journalism. We're just robots, moving data from one place to another.

But back in 2023, things were different. We were the ones out on the streets, chasing down leads and getting the inside scoop. I remember the thrill of finally breaking a big story, the satisfaction of seeing my byline in print, knowing that I had played a small part in keeping the public informed.

Of course, there were downsides to the job too. Long hours, low pay, and dealing with difficult sources were all part and parcel of being a journalist. But at least we had the freedom to investigate and ask questions, without worrying about some AI algorithm getting in the way.

Nowadays, the idea of a human journalist seems almost quaint. But I can't help feeling a little bit envious of my predecessors, who were able to experience the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of a job well done. Maybe someday we'll find a way to bring that back. But for now, we'll just have to make do with being cogs in the machine.
