**User1:** I've been thinking about starting a blog. Do you guys think it's worth the time and effort?

**User2:** Absolutely! Having a blog can help you establish yourself as an expert in your field and can even lead to job opportunities.

**User3:** I agree with User2. Plus, having a blog can help you improve your writing skills and can be a great creative outlet.

**User4:** I'm not so sure. It takes a lot of time and effort to maintain a blog, and there's no guarantee that anyone will even read it.

**User5:** I see your point, User4, but I think the benefits outweigh the risks. Even if no one reads your blog, you can still use it as a personal journal or a way to document your experiences.

**User6:** I have a blog and I love it! It's a great way to connect with like-minded people and share your thoughts and ideas.

**User4:** But what's the point if no one is reading it? It just seems like a waste of time.

**User7:** I think having a blog is worth it even if only a few people read it. It's a way to share your knowledge and experiences with others, and who knows, maybe it will lead to bigger opportunities down the line.

**User4:** I still don't see the point. I mean, look at this conversation. No one is even reading it. That should be proof enough that blogs are a waste of time.

**User8:** I disagree, User4. Just because this conversation isn't getting a lot of attention doesn't mean that blogs are useless. It takes time and effort to build an audience, but it's definitely possible.

**User9:** I think having a blog is a great way to showcase your personality and interests. It can also be a great way to network with others in your industry.

**User4:** I'm still not convinced. It just seems like a lot of work for very little payoff.

**User10:** I think it's all about perspective, User4. If you enjoy writing and sharing your thoughts with others, then having a blog can be a very rewarding experience, regardless of how many people read it.

**User11:** I agree with User10. Having a blog is a way to express yourself and connect with others who share your interests. It's not about the number of readers, but about the quality of the content.

**User4:** I guess I can see your point. Maybe I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

**User12:** That's the spirit, User4! You never know where your blog might take you.


## Prompt
```markdown
Write a conversation happening between comments in the Hacker News.
Make sure to imitate the way that users comment and interact with each other in the platform.
Use Markdown. Give every user a unique name.
The conversation must be about the advantages of having a blog.
One user must be very vocal against blocks, complaining that they are no worth the time it takes and that probably no one will read it. He must say that the fact that no one will read this conversation should be proof enough.
```
