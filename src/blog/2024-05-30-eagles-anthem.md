(Verse 1)
Perched high on the mountain, wings spread wide,
Feathers glistenin' in the morning light, can't hide,
Eagle's got a secret, deep inside,
A melody that's been waiting, time to let it ride.

(Chorus)
Eagle's singin', yeah, breakin' the sky,
Notes flyin' high, like a dream, don't lie,
Nature's symphony, can't deny,
Eagle's singin', oh, reachin' for the sky.

(Verse 2)
Wind's whisperin' secrets, trees swayin' low,
Eagle's got a rhythm, let the music flow,
Beats of the heart, wings in tow,
Harmony in the wild, let the world know.

(Bridge)
Mountains echo, valleys reply,
Eagle's song, a lullaby,
Freedom's anthem, can't defy,
Eagle's singin', touchin' the sky.

(Chorus)
Eagle's singin', yeah, breakin' the sky,
Notes flyin' high, like a dream, don't lie,
Nature's symphony, can't deny,
Eagle's singin', oh, reachin' for the sky.

(Verse 3)
Sunset's glow, horizon's kiss,
Eagle's voice, pure bliss,
Every note, a moment missed,
In the wild, where dreams exist.

(Outro)
Eagle's singin', echoes fade,
Night falls, stars parade,
In the silence, serenade,
Eagle's song, forever made.
