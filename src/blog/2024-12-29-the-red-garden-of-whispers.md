  prompt: "a little girl plays with some children in a garden full of white roses. she wore a pretty sparkly white dress. the day was sunny but foggy.\r\n-no one can see these children except her\r\n-one day these children disappear and she never sees them again. \r\n\r\n-she grows up\r\n-she watches all her friends get married and have children. except for her. \r\n-her friend’s children all look exactly like the children she played with as a little girl (the ones that disappeared). she thought her mind was playing tricks on her and her memories were wrong\r\n\r\n-her friends all have post natal psychosis after the midwives give them drugs as ordered by soldiers\r\n-a war breaks out. she and her friends all lose their homes and end up in serious poverty. the soldiers want to hurt the mothers/children and send them off to concentration camps to be tortured \r\n-the mothers felt like they had no choice but to kill themselves and their children (so they won’t have to put up with the trauma of being alive in the future)\r\n-they successfully killed their children with poison and buried them in a garden\r\n\r\n-it was the same garden the woman played in as a little girl. it was a freezing snowy day. she stood there in a long black dress and a sad expression on her face like she was there for a funeral. everyone thought the roses in this garden were red. but she was the only one who knew the roses were always white. they’re red now because they were covered in the children’s blood. there were many red roses."

In a quaint village, nestled within lush landscapes and vibrant flora, lived a little girl named Elara. She was often seen skipping along the cobblestone paths in a garden overflowing with white roses. The garden seemed enchanted, as a mystical fog always lingered, casting an ethereal glow on the sparkly white dress she wore. Yet, something about this garden was extraordinary, unseen by adult eyes: it hosted a troupe of children only visible to Elara.

These spectral companions were her playmates, whispering secrets and sharing laughter that danced through the fog. Together, they painted the days with joy and wonder, weaving tales that only innocent hearts could fathom. Then, one fateful day, as abruptly as a wilting rose, the mirth and magical children vanished, leaving Elara alone to wander through her childhood's dreamy haze.

Years rolled by like delicate petals in the wind. Elara blossomed into a graceful woman, witnessing her circle of friends step into matrimonial bliss, cradling their own babies in their arms. They reveled in the joys of parenthood, but not Elara. She never married, nor did she bear children; yet, a strange familiarity tugged at her heart whenever she looked into the eyes of her friends’ offspring. They mirrored the faces of those long-lost companions from her childhood garden, and she found herself questioning the reliability of her own memories.

As the village fell under the shadow of a looming war, life shifted dramatically. The once peaceful region spiraled into chaos, and the soldiers' presence grew conspicuous. Under their stern command, midwives administered drugs to the new mothers, leading them down a dark path into postnatal psychosis. In the turmoil of war, these mothers, including Elara’s close friends, succumbed to desperation, believing that there was no escape from the trauma that awaited them and their children. 

With aching hearts, they made the harrowing decision to poison their young, sparing them from a grim future shadowed by fear and suffering. They laid the children to rest in the very garden where Elara had once played, on a day when the world was shrouded in a cruel blanket of snow. She stood there, draped in a long black dress, her somber gaze fixed on the blanket of redness that now covered the earth.

Everyone who passed by would often comment on the vibrant red roses that adorned the garden. Yet, only Elara knew the truth—a chilling reminder of innocence lost. The roses had always been white, symbolizing purity and youth. Now, they were stained red, a haunting testament to the sacrifices of the children and their mothers, their vibrancy stolen by the blood that marked their tragic end.

Elara stood among those red roses, carrying the weight of memories both cherished and cursed—white roses and ethereal whispers that only she had seen, now recolored by the darkness of reality. And so, she mourned quietly, the garden a solemn monument to all that was and all that could never be.
