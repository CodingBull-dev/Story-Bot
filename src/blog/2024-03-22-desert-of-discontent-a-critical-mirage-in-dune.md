Dune. Oh, Dune. Where do I even begin with this arid, over-hyped desert of a film? Let’s traverse the sands of my discontent and dissect why this movie, despite its grandiose presentation and blinding sandstorms of media praise, fails to resonate with this particular critic.

Firstly, let's address the elephant in the room - or should I say, the sandworm in the dunes. Yes, the visual effects are impressive. But what is a movie without soul, without the warmth of characters we care about, without dialogue that doesn't feel like it was carved out of a monolith of wooden clichés? "Dune" prioritizes spectacle over substance, leaving viewers parched for a drop of genuine human connection.

Denis Villeneuve, the director, seems to have mistaken length for depth, crafting a narrative so drawn out that one might mistake the viewing experience for an actual journey across a desolate wasteland. You could literally age a fine wine in the time it takes for something of consequence to happen.

The pacing of the film is as sluggish as a sandworm on a cold night. It lumbers through its storyline with the arrogance of a film that believes its own hype, trading in necessary exposition and character development for prolonged shots of deserts and spaceships. The result is a movie that feels more like a slideshow of admittedly stunning wallpapers rather than a cohesive tale.

And then we have the characters – or as I like to call them, the cardboard cutouts of Arrakis. Paul Atreides, portrayed by Timothée Chalamet, is as bland as the unseasoned, moistureless bread the Fremen must subsist on. His journey, supposedly the heart of this saga, evokes all the emotional depth of a puddle on a dry Chani rock. Speaking of Chani, portrayed by Zendaya, she's barely present, a mirage tantalizing the audience with the promise of a meaningful character who gets lost in the vast, endless desert of missed opportunities.

The performances, while not terrible, are suffocated by a script that seems to have been written by a Bene Gesserit practicing the art of verbosity. Every line is delivered with such an unwarranted gravitas that one can't help but wonder if the cast was convinced they were delivering the sacred text of some long-lost civilization, rather than a script adapted from a novel.

Let’s not forget the music. Hans Zimmer, whose scores I usually find as engaging as the next enthusiast, seems to have been overtaken by the spirit of the sandworm itself – producing a soundscape that is at times so bombastic and invasive, it nearly drowns out the already inaudible dialogue. The constant drone of what I can only assume is a didgeridoo gone rogue does little to enhance the viewing experience, even if it might occasionally remind you to check if your sound system is still functioning.

But it's not all thunderous, invasive music and stilted lines. No, we also have a narrative so fractured that one needs a Litany Against Fear just to keep up with the plot points being tossed around like sand in a storm. The film is less an adaptation of Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and more a highlight reel that forgets to provide context or emotional investment in the scenes it's highlighting.
