  prompt: "Narrate the currents event going on in reddit and if asked for the title, name it \"The War for Reddit\":\r\n\r\nELI5: Why are so many subreddits “going dark”?\r\nCommunities across reddit are going \"dark\", also known as going private, due to concerns about reddit's proposed change in relationship to third-party apps.\r\n\r\nIs Explain Like I'm Five going dark, too?\r\n\r\nWe share the frustrations of many other redditors regarding the changes. We have decided to join thousands of other subreddits in taking action to demonstrate our concerns are suspending normal operations to draw attention to the issue. Specifically, for two days starting on June 12 we will:\r\n\r\nNo longer allow new posts on r/explainlikeimfive\r\n\r\nKeep this sticky available\r\n\r\nSo, you’re not going dark?\r\n\r\nNot at this time. ELI5 is, after all, a place to learn. We have decided to focus ELI5 on learning about the controversy — so that users can become informed of this crucial issue and take action or express their opinions.\r\n\r\nPrivate subreddits' public pages have no space to provide detailed explanations, and so we believed it would better fulfill the subreddit’s mission if instead of going fully private, we keep this sticky available and block any new posts.\r\n\r\nHow long will this last?\r\n\r\nThe joint movement by subreddits is initially set to last two days. Some individual subreddits plan to stay dark indefinitely. r/explainlikeimfive doesn't know what the situation will look like in two days. Hopefully we will see reddit making meaningful progress to address the concerns that have been raised, and so that's what we're aiming for at this time.\r\n\r\nWhat is prompting all these concerns?\r\n\r\nWe previously posted a sticky with our own version of an ELI5, but subsequently we saw that r/askhistorians did a better job of it, so we’re going to “plagiarize” much of what they wrote here:\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 2023, Reddit announced it would begin charging for access to its API. Reddit faces real challenges from free access to its API. Reddit data has been used to train large language models that underpin AI technologies, such as ChatGPT and Bard, which matters to us at AskHistorians because technologies like these make it quick and easy to violate our rules on plagiarism, makes it harder for us to moderate, and could erode the trust you have in the information you read here. Further, access to archives that include user-deleted data violates your privacy.\r\n\r\nHowever, make no mistake, we need API access to keep our community running. We use the API in a number of ways, both through direct access and through use of archives of data that were collected using the API, most importantly, Pushshift. For example, we use API supported tools to:\r\n\r\nFind answers to previously asked questions, including users' answers to questions that were effectively deleted by other users (the question-askers)\r\n\r\nMonitor the health of the subreddit and track how many questions get answers.\r\n\r\nModerate via mobile (when we do)\r\n\r\nAdmins have promised minimal disruption; however, over the years they’ve made a number of promises to support moderators that they did not, or could not follow up on, and at times even reneged on:\r\n\r\nIn 2015, in response to widespread protests on the sub, the admins promised they would build tools and improve communication with mods.\r\n\r\nIn 2019 the admins promised that chat would always be an opt-in feature. However, a year later an unmoderated chat feature was made a default feature on most subs\r\n\r\nIn 2020, in response to moderators protesting racism on Reddit, admin promised to support mods in combating hate\r\n\r\nIn 2021, again, in response to protests, Reddit’s admin promised a feature to report malicious interference by subreddits promoting Covid denial. Reddit’s admin has certainly made progress. In 2020 they updated the content policy to ban hate and in 2021 they banned and quarantined communities promoting covid denial. But while the company has updated their policies, they have not sufficiently invested in moderation support.\r\n\r\nReddit admins have had 8 years to build a stronger infrastructure to support moderators but have not.\r\n\r\nAPI access isn’t just about making life easier for mods. It helps us keep our communities safe by providing important context about users, such as whether or not they have a history of posting rule-violating content or engaging in harmful behavior. The ability to search for removed and deleted data allows moderators to more quickly respond to spam, bigotry, and harassment. On ExplainLikeImFive, we’ve used it to help identify accounts that spam ChatGPT generated content that violates our rules. If we want to mod on our phones, third party apps offer the most robust mod tools. Further, third party apps are particularly important for moderators and users who rely on screen readers, as the official Reddit app is inaccessible to Blind individuals. Mods need API access because Reddit doesn’t support their needs. We are highly concerned about the downstream impacts of this decision. Reddit is built on volunteer moderation labor that costs other companies millions of dollars per year. While some tools we rely on may not be technically impacted, and some may return after successful negotiations, the ecosystem of API supported tools is vast and varied, and the tools themselves require volunteer labour to maintain. Changes like these, particularly the poor communication surrounding them, and cobbled responses as domino after domino falls, year after year, risk making r/ExplainLikeImFive a worse place both for moderators and for users—there will likely be more spam, fewer posts helpfully directing users to previous answers to their questions, and our ability to effectively address trolling, and JAQing off will slow down.\r\n\r\nWithout the moderators who develop, nurture, and protect Reddit’s diverse communities, Reddit risks losing what makes it so special. We love what we do here at ExplainLikeI’mFive.\r\n\r\nA third party app is just another way you can read and post to reddit. Before reddit had its own app for your phone, there were other apps that let you read, post and comment. These apps use something called the API ELI5:How does an API Work?. Reddit's API lets your computer or phone get posts and comments without having to use a web browser or the official app. Apps such as Reddit is Fun, Slide, Comet, Boost, or Apollo then take what the API gives them and displays it. Apps like this allow you to customize your reddit experience by changing a theme, or changing how you upvote a post. While those are just two very small examples, you can begin to understand why people like these apps. Have you ever gotten mad at the reddit app because it had bugs, or it was just weird about how it did something? Right now, and until July 1st, you have the option to try out one of these apps and see if you like reddit better this way. After July 1st, you won't have the option anymore. If reddit's app has a bad bug, and you can't read posts for half a day, you will no longer be able to pull up a second option on your phone, or a third option, or a fourth...\r\n\r\nWhat are the next steps, and how long will all this last?\r\n\r\nWe’re not sure. It depends on how the broader conversation goes. As you might imagine, there are a variety of views among our moderator team. But in general, our views are, again, similar to those on r/askhistorians:\r\n\r\nWe understand Reddit’s need to change and evolve. For all we may harp on Reddit’s flaws, we do want to see it succeed! After all, we wouldn’t exist without it. So, if we’re expecting Reddit leadership to listen to us, we should be willing to work with them. In the days following the publication of the post, we discussed as a team what the specifics of working with Reddit would look like so we could clearly articulate it to you. Compromise means something along the lines of:\r\n\r\nUpdates to the API are not tied to a particular date but are, instead, rolled out once the roadmap shared here is successfully achieved.\r\n\r\nAccessibility tools such as screen readers are part of the native Reddit infrastructure.\r\n\r\nUpdates are made across Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nWe think slowing down is the right thing to do. It would minimize further disruption while also generating an income stream for Reddit."

The War for Reddit is currently raging on as subreddits across the platform are going dark in protest of the proposed changes to the relationship between Reddit and third-party apps. This move has been sparked by Reddit's announcement that it will begin charging for access to its API, which has raised concerns among moderators and users alike. The fear is that this move will make it harder for moderators to manage their communities and may lead to a decline in the quality of content on the platform.

The ELI5 subreddit is one of the many communities that have joined in the protest by suspending normal operations for two days to draw attention to the issue. However, instead of going fully private, the subreddit has decided to focus on learning about the controversy so that users can become informed of this crucial issue and take action or express their opinions.

The concerns raised by the moderators and users are not unfounded, as Reddit has a history of making promises to support moderators that it did not follow up on. Despite the promises made by the admins to minimize disruption, there are fears that this move will have far-reaching downstream impacts that may make Reddit a worse place for moderators and users alike.

The joint movement by subreddits is initially set to last two days, but some individual subreddits plan to stay dark indefinitely. The moderators of ELI5 are not sure how long their protest will last, as it depends on how the broader conversation goes. They are, however, willing to work with Reddit to find a compromise that would be beneficial to all parties involved.

The next steps in this ongoing battle are unclear, but what is certain is that the War for Reddit is far from over. The outcome of this fight will have far-reaching consequences for the future of the platform, and it remains to be seen who will emerge victorious.
