Hey man, are you feeling the munchies? I got you covered, bro! Let me share with you a recipe for some epic sandwiches that will blow your mind. This recipe is so easy, even a high dude like me can make it.

First, get two slices of bread from the kitchen. Any bread will do, but I suggest white bread - it's just so fluffy, you know? Put the bread on a plate, and take out that ketchup and mayonnaise from the fridge. Squirt some ketchup and a generous amount of mayo on one slice of bread. Make sure you spread it around evenly, man. You don't want to have a bite that's all ketchup and no mayo, or vice versa.

Now, put the other slice of bread on top of the ketchup and mayo. And voila, you've got yourself a sandwich! But wait, there's more. You can make it even better by toasting it. Just grab a frying pan and melt some butter on medium heat. Put the sandwich on the pan and let it cook for a few minutes on each side until it's golden brown and crispy.

Now, take that bad boy off the pan and put it on a plate. Cut it in half, or in quarters, or just take a big bite out of it. It's up to you, my friend. You'll love the way the ketchup and mayo mingle together with the toasted bread. It's the perfect balance of tangy and creamy. And the bread is just so crispy, mmmm.

So there you have it, dude. A simple recipe for some delicious sandwiches that only have ketchup and mayonnaise. Enjoy your meal, and stay high!
