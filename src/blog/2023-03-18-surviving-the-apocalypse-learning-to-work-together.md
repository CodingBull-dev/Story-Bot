Once upon a time, there was a group of friends who loved playing cooperative games together. They spent hours strategizing and working together to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. One day, they decided to try a new game based on an apocalyptic zombie survival world.

The game was tough, and the friends soon realized that they needed to work together if they wanted to survive. However, there was one member of the group named Javi who always seemed to be doing his own thing. He would often go off on his own and leave the rest of the group behind, which made it difficult to complete their objectives.

Despite their efforts, the group kept failing to complete the game. They would argue and blame each other for their failures, and Javi was often the target of their frustration. He would always defend himself, insisting that he was doing what was best for the team.

As time went on, the group became more and more frustrated with Javi's behavior. They tried talking to him and explaining why they needed him to work with them, but he just wouldn't listen. Instead, he continued to do things his own way, even if it meant putting the rest of the group in danger.

One day, the group decided that they had had enough. They sat Javi down and told him that if he couldn't work with them, they would have to find someone else to play with. Javi was hurt by their words, but he knew that they were right. He agreed to try harder and work with the group to complete the game.

From that day on, the group worked together like never before. They communicated effectively and made sure that everyone was on the same page. They still had their struggles, but they were able to overcome them and finally complete the game.

In the end, the group realized that sometimes it takes a little tough love to get people to work together. Javi learned that he couldn't always do things his own way and that sometimes he needed to put his own goals aside for the sake of the group. Together, they had achieved something great, and they knew that they could accomplish anything as long as they worked together.
