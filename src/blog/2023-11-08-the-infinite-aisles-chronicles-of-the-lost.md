Captain's Log - Day 1:

As I pen this down, I find myself standing amidst the labyrinthine aisles of an Ikea store. My memory of how I got here is foggy, but the pressing issue is not how I arrived, but how to escape. 

Captain's Log - Day 3:

I have encountered others. A family of four from Ohio, a couple of college students, and an old man who insists he came in just for Swedish meatballs. We've formed a makeshift community, pooling our knowledge of flat-pack furniture assembly to survive. 

Captain's Log - Day 7:

We've built a fortress in the living room section. It's not much, but it's home. We've fashioned weapons out of Allen keys and wooden dowels, our only protection against the lurking beasts of Ikea.

Captain's Log - Day 10:

The store seems to be alive. At night, we hear distant roars, the screeching of metal, and the low hum of the overhead lights. We've spotted the monsters - grotesque, twisted forms that move in the shadows, their eyes reflecting a cold, neon glow. 

Captain's Log - Day 15:

We've lost the old man. He ventured too far into the store, drawn by the scent of those damned meatballs. We found his glasses near the kitchenware section. The situation is growing dire.

Captain's Log - Day 22:

Our outpost stands strong, but morale is low. The college students, Jake and Lily, have started arguing. The family from Ohio is silent, their eyes hollow. We've made another attempt to map our surroundings, but the layout changes overnight. It's like trying to navigate a dream.

Captain's Log - Day 30:

We've encountered another group. They've turned the children's section into a stronghold, complete with a moat of spilled lingonberry syrup. Their leader, a woman named Marcy, has been here longer than any of us. She claims there's no exit.

Captain's Log - Day 37:

We've merged with Marcy's group. Our numbers are stronger, but the monsters are getting bolder. We've set up patrols, using the bright show lights to keep them at bay. 

Captain's Log - Day 45:

We've made a horrifying discovery. The monsters... they're us. Or rather, versions of us twisted by despair and lost time. I saw the old man among them, his eyes now neon, his form distorted. We've stopped looking for the exit. Now, we're just trying to hold on.

Captain's Log - Day 60:

This may be my last entry. The monsters are closing in. We've used every piece of furniture we could assemble, but it's not enough. If anyone finds this, know that we fought, we survived, and we kept our humanity in this endless maze. Ikea, the place of dreams, has become our nightmare. We are the lost souls of the infinite store. 

End of Log.
