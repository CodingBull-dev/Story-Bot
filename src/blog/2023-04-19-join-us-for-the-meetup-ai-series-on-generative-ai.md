Dear Friends, colleagues, and fellow technologists,

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the brand new Meetup AI series on Generative AI! We are thrilled to have you join us for this exciting event where we will explore the latest developments in the field of AI and how it is being used to create innovative products and solutions. 

Our aim is to provide a platform for experts, enthusiasts, and beginners to come together and share their knowledge, ideas, and experiences. We have an exciting lineup of speakers who will be sharing their insights on the underlying technology powering new AI products, and easy-going conversations about utilizing those tools. 

To kick off our series, we have partnered with the Spiced Academy for our first Prompt Me Up Event! We are excited to have Tabea Kossen, who will be presenting on the underlying technology behind Generative AI and how it is being used for Medical Imaging. Pavel Romanenko will also be sharing his thoughts on how enterprises are planning for the utilization of Gen AI Tools. And to cap us off, Mario Savovski will introduce our Gen AI Community corner with cool projects our members are working on.

We encourage you to stay for some networking and further discussion on the development of generative AI products. This is a great opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and learn from experts in the field.

For those who are interested in contributing to the community, please reach out to Nicholas Borsotto or Mario Savoski on LinkedIn to offer examples, thoughts, and recommendations.

We would like to extend our gratitude to our sponsor, Spiced Academy, for their support in making this event possible. They are committed to propelling highly motivated people into the careers they want, through meticulously curated tech courses. They offer intensive training in Web Development, Data Science, Data Analytics, and UX/UI, all taking place at their beautiful community space in Kreuzberg. 

We hope you enjoy the event and look forward to seeing you there!
