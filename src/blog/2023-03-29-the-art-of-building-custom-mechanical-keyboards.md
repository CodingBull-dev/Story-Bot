There once was a man named Jack who had a passion for custom mechanical keyboards. He spent hours upon hours researching, designing, and assembling his own keyboards. His obsession started when he first discovered the satisfying feel of a mechanical keyboard compared to a regular membrane keyboard. From that moment on, he knew he could never go back to using a regular keyboard again.

Jack's love for mechanical keyboards quickly grew, and he started to explore the world of custom keyboards. He would spend his days browsing forums, watching YouTube videos, and joining online communities to learn more about the art of building mechanical keyboards. He would spend hours looking at different keycaps, switches, and PCBs, trying to find the perfect combination for his next build.

One day, Jack decided to take the plunge and build his own custom mechanical keyboard. He started by researching the different types of switches available and settled on Cherry MX Browns for their tactile feel and quiet sound. He then chose a 60% PCB, which is a compact size that's perfect for portability.

Once Jack had all his components, he started to assemble his keyboard. He began by soldering the switches onto the PCB and then attached the stabilizers to the larger keys. He then mounted the PCB onto the case and screwed it all together. Finally, he added his keycaps, and his custom mechanical keyboard was complete.

Jack felt a sense of pride and accomplishment as he typed away on his newly built keyboard. He loved the feel of the Cherry MX Browns and the sound they made when he typed. He was also pleased with the compact size of the keyboard, which made it easy to take with him wherever he went.

From that day on, Jack's obsession with custom mechanical keyboards grew even stronger. He started to build more keyboards, each one more complex and unique than the last. He even started to sell his creations to others who shared his passion.

Building a custom mechanical keyboard may seem daunting, but with the right components and a little bit of patience, it can be a rewarding and satisfying experience. Just like Jack, you too could join the ranks of the custom mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and create your own masterpiece.
