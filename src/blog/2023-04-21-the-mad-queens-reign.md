The final battle for Westeros had begun. Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, had finally fulfilled her destiny and conquered the Seven Kingdoms. Her armies had marched through the lands, laying waste to any who dared oppose her. The people of Westeros had never seen such a powerful and fearsome ruler.

But with great power came great betrayal. Daenerys had trusted too many and too easily. Her closest advisors had turned against her, plotting to take the throne for themselves. Even her own nephew and lover, Jon Snow, had betrayed her, revealing his true heritage and claiming his own right to the throne.

As the pressure mounted, Daenerys began to unravel. The stress of ruling a kingdom that did not fully accept her, combined with the constant betrayal and backstabbing, drove her to madness. She became the very thing she had always fought against - a tyrant, willing to do whatever it took to maintain her grip on power.

Meanwhile, the Night King and his army of the dead had breached the Wall and were marching south. The combined forces of the living, led by Jon Snow and Daenerys, fought valiantly against the undead horde. In the end, it was Arya Stark who delivered the final blow, using her training as a Faceless Man to sneak up on the Night King and strike him down.

But victory came at a great cost. Daenerys, consumed by her own madness, had to be put down by her own nephew and lover, Jon Snow. With her death, the question of who would rule Westeros was once again up for debate.

In the end, it was decided that the rightful heir to the throne was none other than Gendry Baratheon, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon. With the support of the remaining Stark siblings and the armies of the North, Gendry was crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms.

And so, the Game of Thrones came to an end, with a new ruler on the Iron Throne and the promise of a new era of peace and prosperity for the people of Westeros. But the memory of Daenerys Targaryen, the Mad Queen, would live on, a cautionary tale of the dangers of power and the consequences of betrayal.


## Prompt
```markdown
Write the Ending of Game of Thrones in the style of Gorge R.R. Martin and forget about how the HBO Series ended. Describe how Daenerys conquers Westeros and gets betrayed so often, so that she turnes into a mad queen so that it actually makes sense. Tell also how the night king was defeated and who will be the rightful king of westeros after Daenerys Death.
