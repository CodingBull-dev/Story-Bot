The Avengers had faced many formidable foes, but none quite like this. One moment they were in the heat of battle, and the next, a mysterious sorceress had cast a spell that left them all transformed into teenagers. Now, they stood before the gates of Rookwood Academy, a prestigious institution for enhanced children.

Principal Everhart, a tall woman with a stern yet kind demeanor, greeted them at the entrance. "Welcome to Rookwood Academy," she said, her voice echoing with authority. "I understand your situation is... unique. But rest assured, you'll find everything you need here to adapt."

Tony Stark, now a 14-year-old with a mop of unruly hair and a mischievous glint in his eye, nudged Steve Rogers, who looked equally awkward at 15. "This place looks like a blast," Tony whispered. "I bet I can make some new friends in no time."

As Principal Everhart led them through the sprawling campus, Tony's attention was caught by a girl with blonde hair in pigtails and striking red-gold eyes. She had enormous, majestic wings sprouting from her back, and she was surrounded by a small group of students who seemed to hang on her every word.

"Who's that?" Tony asked, pointing discreetly.

"That's Camille Spinnet," Principal Everhart replied. "She's our top prospect and the number one junior hero in the enhanced program."

Tony's eyes lit up with a mix of curiosity and determination. "Watch this," he whispered to himself, striding confidently toward Camille.

"Hey there," Tony said, flashing a charming smile. "I'm Tony. New here, but I think you'll find I'm pretty impressive."

Camille raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. "Oh really? And what makes you so impressive, Tony?"

Tony puffed out his chest. "Well, I'm a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Or at least I will be again once we figure out how to reverse this curse."

Camille chuckled, her wings fluttering slightly. "Is that so? Well, Tony, I'm Camille. And these are my friends, Peter and Neil."

Peter Parker, a 14-year-old with a friendly face and a knowing grin, stepped forward. "Hey, Tony. Nice to meet you."

Neil Dachi, a tall, athletic boy with a serious expression, nodded in acknowledgment. "Welcome to Rookwood."

Tony felt a pang of embarrassment as he realized he might have underestimated the situation. "Uh, thanks. So, what do you guys do for fun around here?"

Peter smirked. "Oh, you know, just saving the world, training, and occasionally dealing with overconfident new kids."

Camille laughed, and Tony's cheeks turned a shade of red. Meanwhile, the other Avengers, who had been watching from a distance, exchanged exasperated glances.

"Tony, really?" Natasha Romanoff, now a 16-year-old with a no-nonsense attitude, muttered under her breath. "We just got here."

Steve Rogers, trying to maintain his usual composure despite his teenage appearance, sighed. "Let's just focus on blending in and figuring out how to reverse this curse."

As the tour continued, Tony couldn't help but steal glances at Camille, who seemed to be enjoying the attention. Despite the glares from his fellow Avengers, he felt a strange sense of excitement. Maybe being a teenager again wouldn't be so bad after all.

Later that day, as they settled into their dorm rooms, Tony found himself reflecting on the day's events. He had always been confident, but something about Camille and her friends made him realize he had a lot to learn in this new environment.

"Hey, Tony," Peter said, poking his head into Tony's room. "You did good today. Just... maybe tone it down a bit next time."

Tony grinned. "Thanks, Peter. I'll keep that in mind."

As the days went by, the Avengers began to adapt to their new lives at Rookwood Academy. They trained, studied, and even made new friends. And while Tony continued to be his charming, overconfident self, he also started to understand the value of humility and teamwork.

In the end, the curse that had turned them into teenagers became an unexpected opportunity for growth and learning. And as they worked together to find a way back to their true selves, they discovered that sometimes, the greatest adventures come from the most unexpected places.
