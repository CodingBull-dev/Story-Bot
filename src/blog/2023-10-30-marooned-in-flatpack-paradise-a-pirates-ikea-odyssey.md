Captain's Log, Date: Unknown

We've been adrift for what feels like an eternity, lost in a sea of Swedish design and flat-pack furniture. The crew and I, once feared pirates of the seven seas, now find ourselves marooned in a labyrinth of showrooms, each more bewildering than the last.

Day 1: We set foot on this strange land, lured by the promise of affordable home furnishings and the siren call of Swedish meatballs. The crew was in high spirits, eager to explore the vast expanse of this place they call "IKEA". Little did we know the trials that lay ahead.

Day 3: We've been wandering aimlessly, following the arrows on the floor, but they seem to lead us in circles. We've passed the same BILLY bookcase at least a dozen times. The crew's morale is dwindling. The only thing keeping us going is the occasional discovery of a bin full of plush shark toys or a display of colorful FÄRGRIK mugs.

Day 7: We've lost sight of the exit. The crew is growing restless. We've resorted to building makeshift shelters out of KALLAX shelving units and MALM bed frames. The meatballs have run out, and we've been subsisting on a diet of lingonberry jam and crispbread.

Day 10: Mutiny is in the air. Half the crew wants to follow the arrows, the other half insists on using the store map. I've tried to keep the peace, but I fear a showdown is inevitable. 

Day 15: We've made a startling discovery. A secret passage hidden behind a PAX wardrobe led us to a place they call "As-Is". It's a treasure trove of slightly damaged goods and returned items, a beacon of hope in our dire situation.

Day 20: We've established a base camp in the "As-Is" section. The crew has taken to fashioning weapons out of spare ALLEN keys and discarded EKTORP sofa covers. We've managed to capture a few of the elusive staff, but they only speak in cryptic instructions and diagrams.

Day 25: We've made contact with other lost souls. A family of four, a couple on their first date, a man who came in for just one lamp... They've all been trapped here, wandering the aisles of IKEA. We've banded together, vowing to find a way out or die trying.

Day 30: We've mapped out the entire store. The exit is within our grasp. But the crew is hesitant. They've grown accustomed to the comfort of their POÄNG armchairs and the warmth of their RYET light bulbs. I fear we've become too domesticated, too... Swedish.

Day 35: Today, we make our final push. We will follow the arrows, we will brave the checkout lines, we will escape this flat-pack hell. If we don't make it, let this log serve as a warning to all who dare to enter IKEA. Beware the allure of affordable home furnishings, for it may be your doom.
