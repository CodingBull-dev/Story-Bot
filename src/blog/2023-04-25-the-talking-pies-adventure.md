Once upon a time, in a small bakery in a quaint little town, there was a freshly baked pie. It was a beautiful apple pie, with a golden crust and a sweet aroma that filled the bakery. But something strange happened that day. As soon as the baker placed the pie on the counter, it started talking!

The baker was shocked and couldn't believe his ears. The pie was begging for its life, pleading with the baker not to cut it into pieces and serve it to the customers. The baker was taken aback and didn't know what to do. He had never encountered a talking pie before.

The pie explained that it had a consciousness and feelings, just like any other living being. It didn't want to be eaten and was afraid for its life. The baker was amazed and didn't know how to respond. He had never heard of a talking pie before, let alone a pie that was afraid of being eaten.

The pie continued to plead with the baker, telling him that it had dreams and aspirations, just like any other living being. It wanted to travel the world and see new places, meet new people, and experience new things. It didn't want to end up as a dessert on someone's plate.

The baker was torn. He didn't want to harm the pie, but he also didn't want to waste his hard work and ingredients. He decided to compromise and offered the pie a deal. He would let the pie go free and travel the world, but in return, the pie would have to come back to the bakery and share its experiences with him.

The pie agreed to the deal and was overjoyed. It thanked the baker and promised to come back and share its adventures with him. The baker watched as the pie rolled off the counter and out of the bakery, on its way to a new life of adventure.

From that day on, the baker never looked at his pies the same way again. He realized that even the simplest things in life can have a consciousness and feelings, and that it's important to treat everything with respect and kindness.
