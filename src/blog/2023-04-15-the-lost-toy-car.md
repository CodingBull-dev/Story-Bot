Once upon a tim thir was a litl boy named Tim. He was a vry happy boy who loved to play with his toys and run around in the park. But one day, Tim was feeling very sad becuz he had lost his favorit toy car.

He looked everywhere for it, under his bed, in his closet, and even in the backyard. But he couldn't find his car anywhere. Tim started to cry becuz he loved his car so much and he didn't know what to do without it.

Just then, Tim's mom came into his room and saw that he was crying. She asked him what was wrong and Tim told her about his lost car. His mom gave him a big hug and said, "Don't worry Tim, we'll find your car together."

So, Tim and his mom went back to the park where they had played earlier that day. They looked everywhere and finally, they found Tim's car in the bushes. Tim was so happy that he hugged his mom and said, "Thank you for helping me find my car, Mommy!"

From that day on, Tim learned that it's okay to ask for help when you need it and that even when things seem lost, they can always be found again. And Tim never lost his car again becuz he always kept it close to him.
