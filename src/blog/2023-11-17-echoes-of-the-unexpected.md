1. In Media Res: Begin the story in the middle of the action. This immediately draws the reader into the story and creates a sense of urgency.

   Example: "The sirens were deafening as I sprinted down the alley, my heart pounding in sync with the flashing red and blue lights."

2. Flashback: Start your story with a significant event from the past that shapes the protagonist's present and future.

   Example: "I was seven when I first saw the man in the black suit. He stood at the foot of my bed, his eyes glowing like two silver moons."

3. Dialogue: Start with a conversation. This can be a great way to introduce characters and their relationships, and to set the tone of the story.

   Example: "Do you ever think about death?" Mary asked, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup. 

4. Reflection: Begin the story with the protagonist's thoughts or feelings. This helps to establish the character's voice and gives the reader insight into their mind.

   Example: "I've always had a peculiar fascination with the unknown, the unexplored. It's what led me to become an archaeologist."

5. Description: Start with a vivid description of the setting, creating a strong sense of place that draws the reader in.

   Example: "The city was a canvas of lights, a kaleidoscope of neon signs, tall buildings, and bustling crowds."

6. Anecdote: Begin with a short, amusing or interesting story about a real incident or person. This can be a great way to introduce your main character and to immediately engage the reader.

   Example: "The first time I tried to cook, I almost burned down the house. The fire department had to be called, and my mother banned me from the kitchen for a month."

7. Question: Start with a question that intrigues the reader and encourages them to read on to find the answer.

   Example: "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live forever?"

8. Mystery: Begin with a mystery or puzzle to be solved. This immediately engages the reader's curiosity and pulls them into the story.

   Example: "When I woke up, the house was empty. My family, who had been there just the night before, had vanished without a trace."

9. Unexpected Situation: Start with an unusual or unexpected situation. This can immediately pique the reader's interest and make them want to find out what's going on.

   Example: "I opened my front door to find a zebra standing on my porch."

10. Prophetic Statement: Begin with a prophecy or prediction. This can create suspense and make the reader want to find out if the prophecy will come true.

   Example: "The fortune teller's words echoed in my mind, 'You will meet a stranger who will change your life forever.'"
