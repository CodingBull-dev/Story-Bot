Panel 1:
[Scene: A small, cozy kitchen in a city apartment. The fridge is covered with various magnets and notes. AMY is standing in front of the open fridge, looking distressed. JOSH enters the scene with a sleepy expression, rubbing his eyes.]

AMY: (frustrated) Josh, where’s the almond milk? I swear I bought some yesterday!

JOSH: (yawning) Maybe it grew legs and walked away? 

Panel 2:
[AMY gives JOSH a narrow-eyed glare while holding up a carton of regular milk. JOSH begins searching through the kitchen cabinets nonchalantly.]

AMY: (sarcastic) Very helpful. I bet you put it in the pantry again, didn’t you?

JOSH: (grinning) Hey, at least I remember to buy milk!

Panel 3:
[They both freeze as they hear the undeniable sound of a milk carton being knocked over and spilling. Their cat WHISKERS is seen with a guilty expression by the couch in the living room, almond milk pooling around him.]

AMY & JOSH: (together) Whiskers!

Panel 4:
[Scene: The couple is cleaning up the mess in the living room. AMY is wiping the floor while JOSH is playfully scolding WHISKERS, who looks unbothered.]

AMY: (exasperated) I can't believe we’re late because of a milk mishap.

JOSH: (laughing) City life, huh? At least it's never boring!

Panel 5:
[Scene: AMY and JOSH, now dressed for work, are standing at a bus stop, crowded with people. AMY is clutching her phone, and JOSH has his arm around her.]

AMY: (frantically checking the time) The bus is late again. We’re gonna miss our meeting!

JOSH: (calmly) Relax, we'll make it. Worst case, we blame it on the cat.

Panel 6:
[The crowded bus finally arrives, and they struggle to squeeze inside. They're pressed between other commuters, trying to maintain their balance as the bus lurches forward.]

AMY: (muffled) This is what they mean by 'packed like sardines', right?

JOSH: (struggling) Note to self: work on our synchronized swimming routine.

Panel 7:
[Scene: Evening in the apartment, AMY and JOSH are sitting on their couch with takeout boxes. The city lights shine through their window. They look tired but content. WHISKERS is curled up on JOSH’s lap.]

AMY: (relieved) I thought today would never end.

JOSH: (smiling) Yeah, but we tackled it together. And hey, the takeout is a nice bonus.

Panel 8:
[AMY rests her head on JOSH's shoulder while they share a moment of quiet. The chaos of the day has settled into a peaceful evening.]

AMY: (softly) Despite everything, I wouldn’t trade our little city life for anything.

JOSH: (kissing the top of her head) Neither would I, love. Neither would I.

[They enjoy their meal, the soft sounds of the city hum around them, reminding them that each struggle is just a part of their shared journey.]
