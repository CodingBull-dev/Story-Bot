In the realm of the ordinary, where life was as predictable as the sunrise, lived our protagonist, Kael. Kael was anything but ordinary. He possessed an extraordinary power, the power to leap across worlds and turn back time. But this power came with a peculiar quirk; each time he spoke, he would do so in a different language.

His journey began in his home world, where he uttered his first words in English, "Time to leap." With a swift jump, he found himself in a world of floating islands and sky whales. In this world, he spoke in Spanish, "¿Dónde estoy?" The inhabitants looked at him with confusion, unable to understand his words.

Next, he jumped into a world of endless oceans, where he spoke in French, "Je suis perdu." The merfolk swimming around him merely shrugged, their faces etched with bewilderment. 

In the world of eternal night, he spoke in German, "Ich brauche Hilfe." The nocturnal creatures merely stared, their glowing eyes reflecting their confusion. 

In the world of towering trees, he spoke in Italian, "Sono confuso." The tree-dwelling beings could only tilt their heads, their understanding failing them.

After several more jumps, each accompanied by a different language, Kael found himself in a world inhabited by a group of four beings. They were unlike any he had encountered before. They were humanoid, but their skin shimmered in the colors of the cosmos, their eyes twinkling like distant stars.

Kael approached them, speaking in Japanese, "助けてください." The group of four exchanged puzzled glances. He tried again, this time in Russian, "Я заблудился." The confusion on their faces deepened.

In desperation, Kael continued to speak, cycling through languages - Arabic, Dutch, Greek, Hindi, and more. But each attempt only added to the group's confusion. They tried to communicate back, but their words were alien to him, their language unknown.

Kael felt a pang of frustration. His power, once a blessing, now felt like a curse. He was alone, lost in a sea of worlds, with no way to communicate his plight. But then, he remembered his other power - the power to turn back time.

With newfound determination, Kael spoke in Zulu, "Ngizobuya." And with that, he leapt back in time, back to his home world. He knew he had to find a way to control his powers, to communicate effectively across worlds. 

His journey was far from over. It was just the beginning. He had learned a valuable lesson, though. He was not just a jumper of worlds, but also a bridge between them. And to be that bridge, he needed to find a way to speak a language that all could understand.
