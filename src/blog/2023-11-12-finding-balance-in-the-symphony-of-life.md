In the realm where dawn meets twilight,
In the hush of the moon's soft light,
There exists a place, just right,
A sanctuary from the chaos of the night.

A place where the sun and moon unite,
Where the stars twinkle, oh so bright,
A haven where dreams take flight,
In the heart of the universe, just right.

Not too tight, not too light,
A perfect balance, in plain sight,
A melody that sounds just right,
In the symphony of life, day and night.

In this world of black and white,
There's a spectrum of colors, pure delight,
A rainbow after the rain's might,
A view that feels, just right.

In the whispers of the wind's kite,
In the warmth of love's ignite,
There's a rhythm that feels just right,
A dance of life, in the moonlight.

It's not about the power or the fight,
Not about being wrong or right,
It's about finding that soft light,
That makes everything feel, just right.

So here's to the journey, the endless flight,
To the courage, the strength, the might,
To finding that place, day and night,
Where everything feels, just right.
