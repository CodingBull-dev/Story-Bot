Grog, the iconic beverage revered by pirates in the classic adventure game "Monkey Island," is a drink that's equally notorious for its potent effects and its rather... unconventional ingredients. While the in-game grog consists of ingredients that would challenge even the steeliest of stomachs (including, but not limited to, kerosene, propylene glycol, artificial sweeteners, sulfuric acid, rum, acetone, red dye #2, SCUMM, axle grease, battery acid, and/or pepperoni), worry notâ€”our real-world interpretation will be decidedly more palatable, whilst still capturing the pirate spirit!

Before we embark on this culinary adventure, let's assure that we won't be using any hazardous materials. This version of grog is safe, delicious, and a great addition to any pirate-themed party or gathering.
