Amina: (Takes a deep breath and looks around the plush office before speaking) Thank you for meeting with me, Diana. I know this is... unconventional.

Diana: (Smiles warmly) Unconventional is what we specialize in here, Amina. But tell me, what brings you to embrace this lifestyle? Why become a cuckquean?

Amina: (Sighs) It's not something I ever imagined for myself. But as my body began to change with the pregnancy, I noticed my husband's gaze... wandering. It's not that he doesn't love me or our unborn children, but there's a distance that wasn't there before.

Diana: And why choose me as your mistress?

Amina: I've done my research. You're discreet, professional, and you have a certain... aura about you that I know he'll be drawn to. I want someone who understands the delicacy of the situation.

Diana: (Nods thoughtfully) I see. And these changes in your body you mentioned, can you elaborate on that?

Amina: Of course. My stomach has expanded to accommodate the twins, and it's altered my posture, my walk... everything. My breasts have become larger and more sensitive, preparing for breastfeeding. These are natural changes, but they've made me feel less attractive in my husband's eyes.

Diana: (Leans forward, intrigued) And how do you think these physical changes tie in with your desire to see your husband with someone else?

Amina: (Pauses, choosing her words carefully) Pregnancy has been a journey of transformation, not just physically but emotionally too. I've realized that my desires, my needs have shifted. I want to feel that connection with my husband, even if it's in a way society doesn't quite understand. Watching him with another woman, knowing it's me he comes home to, it's a thrill that rekindles our bond.

Diana: (Nods slowly, a glint of understanding in her eyes) That's a very intimate revelation, Amina. It takes courage to acknowledge and act on such feelings. I respect that, and I believe I can help you and your husband navigate this delicate phase of your relationship.

Amina: (Exhales, visibly relieved) Thank you, Diana. That means more to me than you know.

Diana: (Stands up, extending her hand) Then let's begin this journey together. I agree to be your mistress, Amina. We'll ensure that this experience is fulfilling and respectful for all parties involved.

Amina: (Shakes Diana's hand, a mixture of gratitude and anticipation on her face) I'm ready. Let's make this happen.
