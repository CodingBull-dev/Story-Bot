The last night of summer was a perfect ninety degrees, a true Wisconsin scorcher only rescued by the slight breeze that blew over the water tower. A full moon hung lazily in the sky, casting a silver glow over the familiar group of friends huddled together above the small town of Point Place. The heat gave the night a sort of hazy, dream-like quality that made it feel like anything could happen.

Eric Foreman leaned back against the cool metal surface, his trusty 'Star Wars' t-shirt sticking to his skin. His twin sister, Anna, sat beside him, her legs dangling over the edge, the orange in her hair catching the moonlight. Hyde, Donna, Jackie, and Kelso were scattered around in their usual positions. The sound of clinking beer bottles and giggling filled the air.

"Alright, since it's the last night of summer and all, how about we spice things up with a game of Truth or Dare?" Kelso suggested, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.

"Why not?" Hyde shrugged, seemingly indifferent but with a glint of interest in his eye.

Eric exchanged a knowing look with Anna. Truth or Dare on the water tower wasnâ€™t exactly the smartest or safest idea, but when had that ever stopped them before?

"I'll start," Jackie said, flipping her hair dramatically. "Donna, truth or dare?"

Donna took a swig of her beer before answering. "Dare."

"I dare you to kiss Eric," Jackie declared with a bright smile that was equal parts innocence and mischief.

Eric felt his cheeks burn, and he shifted nervously. Donna arched an eyebrow, glanced at Eric, and shrugged.

"It's just a dare," she said, as if convincing herself more than anyone else. She leaned in, and Eric, caught off guard, met her halfway. Lips touched in a slow, soft kiss, breaking apart after a few seconds.

"Woah," Kelso hooted. "That was... Wow."

Eric and Donna exchanged a brief, confused look, something unspoken passing between them. Then Jackie looked to Anna. "Anna, truth or dare?"

Anna grinned. "Dare."

"I dare you to kiss Hyde," Jackie giggled. 

Anna shot a playful glare at Jackie before turning to Hyde, who looked more interested than surprised. She took a deep breath, leaned in, and pressed her lips to his. The kiss was brief but electric, leaving her strangely exhilarated.

"Alright, guys, I need to use the restroom," Anna said, standing up suddenly and feeling the need to escape for a moment. "Donna, come with me?"

Donna nodded, a knowing look in her eyes. "Sure, I need to go too."

Climbing down the water tower ladder was always a bit tricky, but Anna and Donna managed it with practiced ease. Once on solid ground, they headed toward the small copse of trees just a few yards away.

"That was... something," Donna admitted, her voice breaking the silence as they walked.

"Yeah," Anna agreed. "Hey, since it's the last night of summer, how about a sleepover? We can hang out, watch movies, and..." she hesitated, feeling a rush of daring, "try smoking weed. You've never smoked before, right?"

Donna looked thoughtfully up at the stars. "Yeah, why not? It's the last night of summer, after all."

In the moonlit forest, the air felt cool and soft against their flushed cheeks. They sat down on a fallen log, talking and laughing. Donna pulled out a joint she had swiped from Hyde's stash earlier in the day. She lit it, took a shaky drag, and passed it to Anna, who did the same.

They laughed, giggled about the dares, and whispered secrets; the joint barely affecting them as much as the night's events already had. The talk grew slower, deeper, as the effects of the weed added a dreamy, surreal layer to their conversations.

Suddenly, Anna leaned in, her pulse quickening. "Donna, can I tell you something?"

Donna looked into her friend's eyes, her heart pounding. "Anything."

Instead of speaking, Anna closed the distance between them, pressing her lips softly against Donna's. The kiss was unexpected, tender, and charged with the energy of the night. They pulled away slowly, staring at each other with wide eyes.

The sound of voices startled them, and they quickly separated as Jackie and Kelso rounded the corner.

"There you guys are!" Jackie called, oblivious. "What are you doing down there?"

"Just talking," Anna replied quickly, standing up and brushing herself off. "We should get back up there before they think we got lost."

Donna nodded, still dazed from the kiss, the night, and the whirlwind of emotions. As they made their way back to the ladder, she turned to Anna and whispered, "About that sleepover... let's make it happen."

Anna smiled, feeling an unspoken understanding pass between them. The last night of summer had changed something, and she couldn't wait to see what the new school year would bring for all of them.
