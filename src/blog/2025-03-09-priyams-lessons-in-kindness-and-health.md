Once upon a time, in the busy city of Delhi, there lived a little boy named Priyam. Priyam lived with his family in a place called Madhuban Society. He had a loving mother named Shailly, a caring father named Pramod, and a wonderful big sister named Kashvi, who was seven years old.

Priyam also had a very special teacher named Arushi. She was kind and always had a new story or game to teach Priyam and his friends important lessons every day.

One sunny morning, Priyam woke up feeling hungry. He wanted to eat sweets and chips for breakfast. He ran to his mother, Shailly, and said, "Mom, can I have sweets and chips for breakfast, please?"

Shailly smiled and said, "Priyam, sweets and chips are not good for breakfast. They are junk food and can make you sick if you eat too much."

Priyam felt a little sad. He loved sweets and chips. But then his sister Kashvi came and said, "Priyam, let's have some yummy fruits and milk. They will make us strong and healthy!"

Priyam thought about it and decided to try the fruits and milk. They were delicious, and he felt happy and full of energy.

Later that day, at school, Teacher Arushi gathered all the children for story time. She told them a story about a little bird who loved to eat only sweets. One day, the bird felt too tired to fly because it had eaten too many sweets. The bird learned that eating healthy food helped it fly high and feel happy.

Priyam listened carefully and understood why eating healthy food was important. He raised his hand and said, "I will eat more fruits and veggies!"

Teacher Arushi was proud of Priyam and said, "That's wonderful, Priyam! Healthy food helps us grow strong and smart."

After the story, Teacher Arushi taught the children a game about talking nicely. She said, "If you want something, ask politely. Instead of saying 'I want,' try saying 'Can I please have?'"

Priyam decided to try it. When he wanted a toy from Kashvi, he said, "Kashvi, can I please play with your toy?"

Kashvi smiled and said, "Of course, Priyam! Thank you for asking so nicely."

Priyam felt happy because he learned that talking politely made everyone feel good.

That evening, Priyam's parents, Shailly and Pramod, sat with him. Priyam said, "Thank you, Mom and Dad, for teaching me. I will eat healthy and talk nicely."

His parents hugged him and said, "We are proud of you, Priyam. You are learning to be a kind and respectful boy."

From that day on, Priyam always remembered to eat healthy, talk politely, and respect his elders. He knew that with kindness and good manners, he could make everyone around him happy.

And so, Priyam lived happily with his family, learning new things every day, and growing into a wonderful little boy.
