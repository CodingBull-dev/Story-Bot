Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a recipe for a delicious two-tier chocolate cake with frosting and ganache:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup hot water
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 cup heavy cream

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.

2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. Add the buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix well until combined.

4. Gradually stir in the hot water until the batter is smooth.

5. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.

6. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, remove them from the pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.

7. While the cakes are cooling, make the frosting. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract, and beat until smooth and fluffy.

8. Once the cakes are completely cool, place one cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top of the cake.

9. Place the second cake layer on top of the frosting. Spread another layer of frosting on top of the second cake layer.

10. To make the ganache, place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just begins to boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Then, stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the ganache is smooth.

11. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides.

12. Let the ganache set for 10-15 minutes before serving.

Enjoy your delicious two-tier chocolate cake with frosting and ganache!
