  prompt: "Rory Gilmore is pregnant with Logan’s baby. However, she doesn’t tell him. Instead she chooses to do this alone. She goes into labor while on a walk just outside star’s hollow. Jess sees her and takes her to a hospital. He doesn’t leave her side the entire birth. The baby is sideways and has to be turned. Lorelai gets to the hospital just after Rory’s daughter is born."

The crisp autumn air filled Rory's lungs as she strolled along the familiar path just outside of Stars Hollow. The leaves crunched beneath her feet, and the vibrant colors of fall surrounded her, offering a momentary distraction from the whirlwind of thoughts in her mind. She had chosen this path deliberately, seeking solace in the quiet beauty of nature as she prepared for the monumental change about to enter her life.

Rory had made the decision months ago to face this journey alone. She had weighed the pros and cons, considered the implications, and ultimately decided that she could do this without Logan. It wasn't that she doubted his ability to be a good father; it was more about her need to prove to herself that she could handle this on her own terms. She had always been fiercely independent, and this was no different.

As she walked, a sudden, sharp pain shot through her abdomen, causing her to stop in her tracks. She clutched her belly, breathing deeply, trying to steady herself. But the pain intensified, and she realized with a jolt of panic that she was going into labor. Alone, on a deserted path, with no one around to help.

Just as she was about to succumb to the fear, she heard a voice calling her name. She turned to see Jess Mariano jogging towards her, concern etched across his face. "Rory! Are you okay?" he asked, reaching her side in seconds.

"Jess, I think... I think it's happening," she gasped, clutching his arm for support.

Without hesitation, Jess wrapped an arm around her, guiding her back towards town. "Come on, let's get you to the hospital," he said, his voice calm and reassuring.

The drive to the hospital was a blur of pain and anxiety, but Jess remained a steady presence, holding her hand and offering words of comfort. Once they arrived, the medical staff quickly took over, whisking Rory into a delivery room. Jess stayed by her side, refusing to leave even when the doctors suggested he wait outside.

The labor was complicated. The baby was in a breech position, and the doctors had to perform a delicate procedure to turn her. Rory was exhausted, both physically and emotionally, but Jess's unwavering support gave her strength. He held her hand, whispered encouragements, and reminded her to breathe.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rory heard the first cries of her daughter. Relief washed over her, and tears filled her eyes as the tiny, wriggling bundle was placed in her arms. She looked down at her daughter, overwhelmed by a love she had never known before.

Just then, the door swung open, and Lorelai burst into the room, her face a mixture of worry and joy. "Rory!" she exclaimed, rushing to her daughter's side. "Oh my God, she's beautiful!"

Rory smiled, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Mom, meet your granddaughter," she said softly, her voice filled with emotion.

Lorelai leaned over, gently touching the baby's cheek. "Hello, little one," she cooed, her eyes shining with pride.

Jess stepped back, giving the mother and daughter a moment, but Rory reached out, grabbing his hand. "Thank you, Jess," she said, her voice filled with gratitude. "I couldn't have done this without you."

He nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "Anytime, Rory. Anytime."

As Rory looked around the room, at her mother, her daughter, and Jess, she realized that she wasn't alone after all. She had a family, a support system, and a future filled with love and possibilities. And in that moment, she knew she could face anything that came her way.
