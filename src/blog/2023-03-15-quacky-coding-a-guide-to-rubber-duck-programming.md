Coding on a computer can be an exhausting task if you don't have the right tools at your disposal. But what if I told you that all you need is a duck? Yes, you heard me right! Today, I'm here to guide you on how to code on your computer using a duck.

But before we dive into the instructions, let me remind you of something important. Please, do not look into the duck's eyes. I repeat, do NOT look into the duck's eyes. It may seem like a small warning, but trust me, it's crucial.

Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to purchase a rubber duck. It can be any type of duck, as long as it's rubber. Place the duck on your desk and start coding.

Whenever you get stuck, explain the problem to the duck in detail. Yes, that's right, talk to the duck. I know it sounds strange, but it really works! Explaining the issue to the duck can help you understand it better and find a solution.

Now, let's talk about blockchain. You may be wondering, what does blockchain have to do with a rubber duck? Well, to put it simply, the duck can be your blockchain. Every time you make progress in your code, take a rubber band and wrap it around the duck's neck. Each rubber band represents a block in the chain, creating a visual representation of the progress you're making.

Before I go, I want to remind you one more time, do NOT look into the duck's eyes! It's important for your safety and well-being.

And finally, here's the funny twist. If you ever get stuck and can't seem to find a solution, take the duck for a walk. Sometimes, a change of scenery and a fresh perspective can do wonders for your code. Just don't forget the rubber bands!

Happy coding with your new trusty companion, the rubber duck.
