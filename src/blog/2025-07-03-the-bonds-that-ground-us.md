  prompt: "Write a Harry Potter AU, where Harry grew up with his parents James and Lily Potter. He's self-confident, a bit arrogant but kindhearted. He loves nothing more than to prank alongside his brother in all but blood...Leo Black (son of Sirius Black and Mary MacDonald). Now he embarks on his 6th year where he's bragging to his friends that he's quidditch captain....until his smoking hot redheaded girlfriend Clora McKinnon (the only one who can keep him grounded) smacks his ego down. Harry navigates school life in a large story, pranks, falls more and more in love whilst Voldemort is ressurected by an ancient ritual."

In the bustling halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter strode with an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance. The chatter of students filled the corridors as they returned for their sixth year, and Harry was at the center of it all. His unruly black hair was as untamed as ever, his emerald eyes gleaming with mischief. Walking beside him was Leo Black, his brother in all but blood, whose infectious laughter echoed through the halls.

"Can you believe it, Leo? Quidditch captain," Harry boasted, his chest puffed out with pride as they made their way towards the Gryffindor common room. "I mean, I always knew I'd get it, but still, it's nice to be recognized."

Leo, with his own trademark smirk, clapped Harry on the back. "Well, if anyone deserves it, it's you, mate. You've been the best Seeker Hogwarts has seen in ages. Just don't let it get to your head too much, yeah?"

Harry chuckled, but before he could respond, a familiar voice cut through the noise. "Don't let what get to his head?" Clora McKinnon appeared beside them, her vibrant red hair cascading like a fiery waterfall. Her eyes sparkled with a warmth that could both melt and scold him in equal measure.

Harry's bravado faltered for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure. "Just talking about being Quidditch captain, Clora. No big deal," he said, trying to sound nonchalant.

Clora raised an eyebrow, a playful yet challenging glint in her eye. "Oh, no big deal, huh? I seem to recall someone spending the entire summer practicing his victory speeches."

Leo laughed, his voice teasing. "Busted, Harry. You should know better than to try and pull one over on Clora."

Harry's cheeks flushed slightly, and he rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "Alright, alright, maybe I was a bit excited. But can you blame me?"

Clora's expression softened as she stepped closer, her hand reaching for his. "Of course not, Harry. I'm proud of you. Just remember, it's not all about the glory. You've got a team to lead now."

Her words, as always, grounded him. No matter how high Harry's ego soared, Clora had a way of bringing him back to Earth, reminding him of what truly mattered.

As they continued their journey to the common room, the trio discussed their plans for the year. Pranks were to be orchestrated, harmless yet elaborate, with Leo and Harry often taking inspiration from their fathers' legendary Marauders' tales.

However, beneath the laughter and the thrill of school life, a darker shadow loomed. Unbeknownst to most, Voldemort was slowly regaining power through an ancient and sinister ritual. Rumors spread like wildfire among the students, whispers of strange happenings and dark magic. Yet, for now, Hogwarts remained a sanctuary, a place where friendships were forged and love blossomed.

As the weeks passed, Harry found himself more captivated by Clora's presence. Her intelligence and wit matched his own, and her ability to challenge him in ways no one else could was both infuriating and exhilarating. They spent late nights in the library, studying and sharing stories, their laughter echoing softly in the quiet aisles.

But even as Harry navigated the complexities of teenage life, his mind occasionally drifted to the growing threat outside the castle walls. He knew it would soon be time to face it, but for now, he cherished the moments of normalcy, the camaraderie of his friends, and the love of a girl who saw beyond the fame and titles.

The school year unfolded with its usual mix of chaos and wonder, the promise of adventure ever-present. And though darkness gathered on the horizon, Harry was ready to meet it head-on, confident in his abilities and surrounded by those he loved. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, for in the end, it was the bonds of friendship and love that would see them through.
