Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who was addicted to drugs. He had tried every drug under the sun and was always on the lookout for new ones to try. One day, Jack decided that he wanted to get his driver's license, even though he was on as many drugs as humanly possible. 

As Jack sat in the driver's seat, he couldn't help but notice the hotdog eating duck running towards him every time he looked in the rearview mirror. It was a strange sight, but Jack was too high to care. 

The driving inspector began to speak, but to Jack, it sounded like he was speaking in parsel, the language of snakes from Harry Potter. Jack answered in parsel, thinking he was doing a great job. 

However, Jack's driving skills were far from great. He ended up killing three people during the exam, but in his drugged-out state, he thought he had aced it. He managed to avoid detention and went home feeling proud of himself. 

But when he got home, he saw the hotdog eating duck from his rearview mirror waving at him from inside his house. The duck was holding all of Jack's papers and everything he owned. The duck had stolen everything from him, including his wife. 

Jack was devastated. He couldn't believe that a duck had managed to steal everything from him. But as he looked closer, he saw his wife dressed in a full duck costume, kissing the hotdog eating duck. 

Jack realized that his drug addiction had caused him to lose everything he had ever cared about. He vowed to get clean and start over, but it was too late. The hotdog eating duck and his wife were gone, and Jack was left alone with nothing but his addiction. 

The moral of the story is that drugs can cause you to lose everything you hold dear. It's important to seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction.
