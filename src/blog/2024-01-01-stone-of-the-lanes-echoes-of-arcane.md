In the underbelly of Zaun, where the air is thick with smog and the cogs of industry never cease their grinding, a boy named Stone grew up alongside his childhood friends Vi, Powder, Mylo, Claggor, and Ekko. They were the scrappy children of the Lanes, the forgotten ones who called the labyrinth of pipes and gears their home. They shared an unbreakable bond, forged in the fires of hardship and survival.

Stone was different from the others, though. Where Vi had her fists, Powder her dreams, Mylo his bravado, Claggor his loyalty, and Ekko his smarts, Stone had his quiet determination. He was the silent rock upon which the others could lean when times got tough, the steady hand in a world that was anything but. His presence was a calming force in the chaos of their daily lives.

On the day that would change their lives forever, the group found themselves embarking on a daring heist, one that would prove their worth to the underground factions of Zaun and set them up for life. Stone was hesitant, knowing the risks, but he couldn't let his friends walk into danger alone. They had a plan, a risky one, to infiltrate one of the enclaves of Piltover, the city of progress that loomed above Zaun, separated by more than just the massive hex-gates.

As they navigated the shimmering streets of Piltover, so different from the grimy alleys of their home, Stone felt a pang of envy. Here, children didn't have to steal to eat; they didn't have to dodge enforcers or breathe in toxic fumes. He pushed the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand.

The target was a laboratory, one rumored to hold valuable hextech technology. The group, masked and cloaked, slipped through the shadows, evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Piltover Wardens. Stone's role was to be the lookout, his keen eyes scanning for any signs of trouble.

They reached the lab, and Vi, with her characteristic bravado, punched through the wall with her augmented strength. The group poured in, grabbing anything that looked valuable. Stone's heart raced, the thrill of the heist mixed with a growing sense of unease. Powder, always the dreamer, found a set of glowing crystals. Her eyes lit up with wonder, but Stone saw the danger. Those crystals were unstable, volatile.

He tried to warn her, but it was too late. The lab erupted in chaos as the crystals detonated, sending shockwaves through the building. Alarms blared, and the group scrambled to escape, but not everyone made it out. Mylo and Claggor were caught in the explosion, their fates sealed in an instant. Stone's heart broke as he saw Vi's expression twist into one of grief and rage, her fists clenched at her sides.

The surviving friends fled back to Zaun, but they were not the same. The heist had shattered their innocence, and the loss of Mylo and Claggor hung heavy over them. Stone tried to be the pillar they needed, but he could see the cracks forming, especially between Vi and Powder. The younger sister's mistake had cost them dearly, and Vi's protective nature turned to bitterness.

As tensions rose, Stone found himself in the middle, trying to keep the peace. He knew that in the unforgiving world of Zaun, unity was their only strength. But some rifts are too deep to heal, and the events of that fateful day would set them on paths they never imagined.

The story of Stone and his friends was just beginning, a tale of loss, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of redemption. In the shadows of progress, among the forgotten children of the Lanes, their story would unfold, echoing the beats of the grander tale that was Arcane.
