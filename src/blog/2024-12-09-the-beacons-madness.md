Ephraim Winslow, or Thomas Howard as he is sometimes known, stumbled away from Thomas Wake's quarters, his mind a turbulent sea of madness and frustration. The lighthouse's dim corridors seemed to close in on him, the walls whispering taunts and secrets only he could hear. The sound of the ocean outside was a constant roar, a reminder of his isolation on this godforsaken rock.

The light—oh, the light! It called to him with an irresistible pull, a siren song that promised revelation and understanding. Yet, it remained out of reach, locked away by the obstinate old man who seemed to guard it with his very life. Ephraim's obsession with the light had grown into a consuming fire, burning away the last vestiges of his sanity.

Back in his quarters, Ephraim sat on the edge of his bed, his hands trembling with a mixture of rage and desperation. The broken knife lay discarded on the floor, a symbol of his failed attempt to seize control. He could still feel the cold steel against Wake's neck, the thrill of power it had given him, yet the old man's unflinching gaze had shattered his resolve.

"Why don't you wear shoes?" Wake's question echoed in his mind, a nonsensical query that seemed to mock his very existence. It was as if the old keeper saw through him, saw the madness lurking beneath the surface. Ephraim's bare feet were a testament to his unraveling, a small rebellion against the mundane routine that threatened to swallow him whole.

The days dragged on, each one an endless cycle of menial labor and suffocating silence. Ephraim found himself talking to the seagulls, his only companions in this desolate place. They would perch on the rocks, their beady eyes watching him with an intelligence that seemed almost human. He imagined they understood his plight, that they too were prisoners of this barren landscape.

At night, the dreams came—visions of the light, blinding and pure, washing over him in waves of ecstasy. In these dreams, he was free, soaring above the lighthouse, the world spread out beneath him like a vast, uncharted map. But each morning he awoke to the grim reality of his confinement, the light still out of reach, a tantalizing specter on the edge of his consciousness.

Ephraim's interactions with Thomas Wake grew increasingly tense, their conversations punctuated by long silences and veiled threats. Wake seemed to sense the change in Ephraim, the way his eyes darted towards the light with a hunger that bordered on madness. Yet, he remained unyielding, a stoic guardian of the beacon that had become Ephraim's obsession.

One stormy night, as the wind howled outside and the sea crashed against the rocks with a ferocity that shook the lighthouse to its core, Ephraim made a decision. He would have the light, no matter the cost. His mind was set, his course unalterable. The time for hesitation was over. The light was his destiny, and he would claim it, even if it meant crossing the line into madness from which there was no return.
