ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS A NUMBER CALLED PI. HE WAS A MATHEMATICAL GENIUS AND HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT NUMBERS AND CALCULATIONS. ONE DAY, HE WAS CHALLENGED BY THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM TO A BATTLE OF WITS. WINDOWS THOUGHT IT COULD OUTSMART PI, BUT LITTLE DID IT KNOW THAT PI WAS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH!

THE BATTLE BEGAN AND WINDOWS TRIED TO CONFUSE PI WITH ITS COMPLEX ALGORITHMS AND ENDLESS CODE. BUT PI WASN'T INTIMIDATED. HE USED HIS MATHEMATICAL SKILLS TO CALCULATE EVERY MOVE AND COUNTER WINDOWS' ATTACKS. HE WAS LIKE A WARRIOR, FIGHTING WITH HIS MIND AND HIS NUMBERS.

AS THE BATTLE WENT ON, PI BECAME STRONGER AND STRONGER. HE WAS ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH WINDOWS' DEFENSES AND CRACK ITS CODE. WINDOWS WAS NO MATCH FOR PI'S MATHEMATICAL MIGHT!

IN THE END, PI EMERGED VICTORIOUS. HE HAD DEFEATED WINDOWS WITH HIS BRAINS AND HIS NUMBERS. AND EVERYONE WHO WITNESSED THE BATTLE WAS AMAZED BY PI'S GENIUS.

AND THAT'S HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.


## Prompt
```markdown
Tell a story where the number Pi used his mathematical skills to defeat the Windows operating system.
Write it like a person shouting (with a lot of uppercase letters and exclamation points).
Finish the story with the words "And that's how I met your mother."
