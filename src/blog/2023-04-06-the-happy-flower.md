Tirafirog is a language spoken by the people of the small village of Erigante. It is a unique language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. Here is a story written in Tirafirog:

Firadek paselis nirog pimento. Bontadek keleris seltamo. Nirog topadek firitilo. Keleris miredek punso. Pimento daradek niradek firitilo.

Translated into English, the story reads:

One day, a young boy went to the forest. He saw a beautiful flower. The boy picked the flower. He gave it to his mother. The flower made her very happy.

In Tirafirog, every word is composed of three syllables. The first syllable indicates the part of speech the word belongs to, the second syllable represents the tense or mood, and the third syllable is the root word. The language follows a strict Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure, with modifiers coming before the root word.

For example, in the first sentence, Firadek means "one day" with "Fira" indicating a time, "dek" marking it as a noun and "-adek" adding the sense of past tense. "Nirog" means "boy" with "Ni" indicating a person, "rog" being the root word and "-og" marking it as a noun. "Pimento" means "forest" with "Pi" indicating a place, "mento" the root word and "-to" marking it as a noun.

Overall, Tirafirog is a language that requires a lot of attention to detail and memorization of syllable combinations. But for the people of Erigante, it is their way of communicating and telling stories that have been passed down for generations.
