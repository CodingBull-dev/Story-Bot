  prompt: "A boy, 16 years of age, was on his own since he could remember. With no idea of his origins, no idea of his purpose, Nathan Blackwing was forced to survive against wave after wave of bounty hunters, armies, soldiers, hunter creeds after him. After a power he holds; the power of Wayfinding. Wayfinding was the ability to navigate land, sea, or even the sky by reading the sun or the stars and the moon. But it came with something else…a strange power."

With every sunset that painted the horizon, Nathan Blackwing felt a familiar stirring in his chest, a pull that urged him to move in specific directions even when he had no particular destination in mind. It was this ability, this unexplainable force, that had been both his greatest blessing and his curse. As long as he could remember, the world around him was a tapestry of shimmering lines and paths that only he could see—fine threads of light that crisscrossed the earth, leading him toward safety or away from danger.

His journey began in the densely-woven forests of Verden, where the leaves murmured secrets of ancient times and the streams whispered of paths long lost to human memory. Here, he first realized the magnitude of his gift—or burden—as bounty hunters tracked him relentlessly. They were driven by tales of his extraordinary abilities, fuelled by promises of riches beyond imagination for his capture.

Nathan's keen intuition always alerted him to their presence, the prickle on his skin a silent alarm. By night, he would gaze at the sky, tracing paths between the constellations; the stars whispered guidance only he could comprehend, a celestial roadmap leading him dozens of steps ahead of his pursuers.

Yet, beneath the surface of his Wayfinding lay another power, disturbing and unfathomable. It manifested sporadically, in moments of intense need or peril. On one occasion, cornered by a group of mercenaries on a rocky mountain pass, Nathan had felt a wild energy surge through him. The ground beneath trembled as he called upon forces he barely understood, causing a landslide that blocked the path and allowed him to escape.

These incidents, though rare, terrified him. Each occurrence left him drained and bewildered, yearning for answers. What was this power within him? Why did it choose only the direst times to reveal itself? The whispers of the past, the conduits of ancient power, all lured him into an awestruck reverie, a mixture of fear and exhilaration.

Despite every treacherous trial, Nathan had allies hidden in the shadows—kind souls who offered aid, food, and lodgings with untold generosity. They were elderly wisdom-keepers, young rebels, and wanderers who believed in the old prophecies that spoke of a Wayfinder who would one day restore balance to a faltering world. He relied on their hope and their tales to find a semblance of family amidst his solitude.

One such ally was Elara, an enigmatic merchant’s daughter who had found him wandering near the city of Tebis. With fiery red hair and a fierce intellect to match, she had become his confidant, helping him piece together fragments of his past. Elara possessed a library of ancient texts, her simplest hobby yet an invaluable treasure trove for Nathan. Through her persistence, they uncovered a forgotten legend—a myth of a Wayfinder who could not only see the paths of the earth and sky but unlock the forces of both time and movement. Only by controlling this duality, the prophecy foretold, could Nathan evade the darkness constantly at his heels.

Years wore on, each chapter of Nathan's life marked by brushes with danger and the steady growth of friendship. Together, he and Elara sought out the remnants of an ancient order known as the Sentinels, who were rumored to have nurtured Wayfinders ages past. The stories claimed they could teach him to understand his power and harness the potential he had only begun to tap into.

Their journey was relentless, punctuated with moments of wonder and dread. As Nathan neared the truth of his origins, the threads of his past began to weave together. Would he find solace in discovering who he was? Or with every revelation, would the weight of expectation grow harder to bear?

Only time, and the paths whispered to him by the stars, would tell.
