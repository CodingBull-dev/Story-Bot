The assertion that Pikachu's victories in battles against other Pokémon, including those of the ground type, are inexplicable and the result of plot armor is a common one among fans of the Pokémon franchise. While it is true that Pikachu has emerged victorious in many battles, it is important to consider the various factors that contribute to these outcomes. 

Firstly, Pikachu's success is not solely due to plot armor, but rather a combination of factors such as its level, moveset, and the skill of its trainer. Pikachu, as a starter Pokémon, is often trained extensively by its trainer and has access to powerful moves that can be used to great effect in battle. Additionally, Pikachu's speed and agility make it a formidable opponent, particularly against slower and less agile Pokémon. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that Pikachu's lack of evolution is not necessarily a hindrance to its success in battle. While evolution can certainly increase a Pokémon's power and abilities, it is not always the best option. In some cases, a Pokémon's unevolved form may have access to moves or abilities that are more effective in battle than those of its evolved form. Additionally, some trainers may choose to keep their Pokémon in their unevolved form for personal or strategic reasons. 

In order to fully understand Pikachu's success in battle, it is necessary to analyze each individual battle and the circumstances surrounding it. For example, in the first season of the Pokémon anime, Pikachu defeats Brock's Onix, a ground type Pokémon that is typically strong against electric types. However, this victory can be attributed to Pikachu's use of its agility and speed to dodge Onix's attacks, as well as its use of powerful electric attacks that were able to overcome Onix's defenses. 

In conclusion, while Pikachu's victories in battle may seem inexplicable at first glance, a closer analysis of the various factors that contribute to these outcomes reveals that they are not solely the result of plot armor. Rather, Pikachu's success can be attributed to a combination of factors such as its level, moveset, and the skill of its trainer. Additionally, Pikachu's lack of evolution is not necessarily a hindrance to its success in battle, as there are many instances where an unevolved Pokémon may be more effective in battle than its evolved form.

It doesn’t make any sense that Pikachu beat so many Pokémons, including ground type. He just have too much plot armor and should have lost most of the time. Also, why hasn’t it evolved yet! It would become very powerful.
