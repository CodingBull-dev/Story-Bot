Once upon a time, there was a man named John who loved sandwiches. He would eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. One day, John woke up feeling strange. He felt like his body was changing, and he couldn't quite put his finger on what was happening. Suddenly, he realized that he was turning into a sandwich!

John was terrified. He had never heard of anyone turning into a sandwich before. He didn't know what was happening to him, or how to reverse it. He tried to scream, but all that came out was a muffled cry. He was trapped inside his own body, unable to move or speak.

As a sandwich, John was filled with fear. He was afraid of being eaten, afraid of being thrown away, and afraid of never being able to turn back into a human again. He felt helpless and alone, like he was trapped in a nightmare.

Days turned into weeks, and John remained a sandwich. He was tossed around in a bag, squished between other sandwiches, and left to grow stale on a shelf. He longed to be human again, to feel the warmth of the sun on his skin and the wind in his hair.

But one day, John's worst fear came true. A hungry human walked into the sandwich shop and ordered a sandwich. John tried to scream, but it was too late. The human picked him up, took a bite, and swallowed him whole.

As John's body was digested, he felt a sense of relief. He was no longer trapped inside a sandwich, no longer afraid of being eaten or thrown away. He was free, in a way, to become a part of something else. And as he faded away, he knew that he would never forget the fear and loneliness he felt as a sandwich.
